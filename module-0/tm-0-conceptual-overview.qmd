## Guiding Questions

1.  Why text mining and **what is it** exactly?

2.  What are **common techniques** used for mining text?

3.  What are some of the **technical and ethical considerations**?

4.  How is text mining **used in STEM education** research?

# 1. A Brief Why and What

Data Sources, Research Opportunities, & Simple Definitions

## Why should I care?

There has been **unprecedented increase in text-based data**[^1]generated by educational processes and digital learning systems, resulting in...

## What is Text Mining

According to my graduate students...

::::::: columns
:::: column
Text mining **is**...

::: incremental
-   a process for gaining insight into large amounts of text

-   an exploration of text in search of patterns

-   like computer-assisted reading

-   magic!
:::
::::

:::: column
Text mining **is not**...

::: incremental
-   a substitute for traditional qualitative analysis

-   as "automated" as one would like it to be

-   unlike reading tea leaves

-   magic!

## A Central Question of Text Mining

# II. Techniques to Quantify Text

Frequency, Dictionaries, Topics, & Networks

## Module 1 – Basic Text Analysis

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
"... it’s a mistake to imagine that text mining is now in a sort of crude infancy, whose real possibilities will only be revealed after NLP matures... **Wordcounts are amazing!**[^2]

-   Text Preprocessing
-   Word Counts
-   Term Frequencies
-   TF-IDF
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](img/word-cloud.png)

Yep, a wordcloud, the pie chart of text mining.

## Module 2 - Dictionary-Based Methods

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Dictionary-based text analysis[^3] uses predefined list of words, or **lexicons**, to assign a particular meaning, value, or category to each word in you data:

-   Sentiment Lexicons
-   Custom Dictionaries
-   Stop Words
-   Linguistic Inquiry Word Count (LIWC)
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
Bing Sentiment Lexicon Example:\
\

```{r, echo=F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidytext)
library(dplyr)
library(DT)
knitr::kable(sample_n(get_sentiments("bing"), 5))
```

## Module 3 - Topic Modeling

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
With a bit of tongue-in-cheek[^4], Meeks and Weingart describe topic modeling as:

> leveraging occult statistical methods like 'dirichlet priors' and 'bayesian models'... to provide seductive but obscure results in the form of easily interpreted (and manipulated) 'topics.'

## Supervised Machine Learning for Text Analysis

::::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
![](img/smltar.jpeg){fig-align="center" width="500"}
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
Supervised machine learning using text involves building a statistical model to predict some output from input that includes language.[^5] Outputs may be:

-   numeric or continuous, such as predicting the year of a United States Supreme Court opinion from text of that opinion.

-   discrete quantities or class labels, such as predicting whether a GitHub issue is about documentation.

## Module 4 - Text as Networks

::::: columns
::: column
Text data can also be quantified and represented as relational data in the form of networks, as in the case of:

-   **Text Networks** where ***individual words*** are the nodes

-   Epistemic Network Analysis where human or automated ***coded text*** are the nodes

And the edges between them describe the regularity with which they co-occur in documents.

# III. Key Considerations

Logistical, Technical, Ethical, & Legal

## Text Mining Considerations

Despite the potential advantages of text-based data captured by educational technologies, TM poses a number of challenges[^6] for STEM Ed researchers.

# III. Research Applications

Performance, Feedback, Engagement, & Other

## Academic Performance

TM has been largely used to **evaluate academic performance** in different contexts, especially to assess essays and online assignments.[^7]

-   Question-answering applications

-   Assist teacher feedback

-   Support formative feedback
:::

## Learner Engagement

TM has been applied to **support student engagement and collaboration**, especially in distance learning courses.

::: incremental
-   Automated writing scaffolds

-   Analysis of interactional resources

-   Student sentiment extraction

-   Dropout prevention
:::

## Other Applications

Other applications of text mining in STEM Ed Research include:

::: incremental
-   Automatic text summarization

-   Analytics & visualization tools

-   Curriculum adaptation

-   Recommendation systems
:::

## Discussion

Consider a small network you are a part of (\~ 5-10 individuals), or may be interested in studying, and think about the following questions:

1.  *Who are the actors in this networks?*
2.  *What types of ties might connect these actors?*
3.  *What individual attributes might be important to capture for SNA?*
4.  *Which actors may be more central (e.g. more ties) in this network?*
