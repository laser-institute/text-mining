<section id="introduction" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">0. INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>In this case study, we’ll <strong>“walkthrough”</strong> a basic research workflow, or data analysis process, modeled after the Data-Intensive Research Workflow from <em>Learning Analytics Goes to School</em> (Krumm et al., 2018):</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

<figcaption>Figure 2.2 Steps of Data-Intensive Research Workflow</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Each walkthrough will focus on a basic analysis using text mining techniques that you’ll be expected to reproduce, and apply to a new research question in independent practice, using the provided dataset or a dataset of your own choosing.</p>
<p>We will focus on the analysis of open-ended survey items from an evaluation of the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction (NCDPI) online professional development offered as part of the state’s <a href="https://www.fi.ncsu.edu/projects/evaluation-of-race-to-the-top/">Race to the Top</a> efforts.</p>
<section id="walkthrough-focus" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="walkthrough-focus">Walkthrough Focus</h3>
<p>Our focus will be on getting our text “tidy” so we can perform some basic word counts, look at words that occur at a higher rate in a group of documents, and examine words that are unique to those document groups. Specifically, the walkthrough will cover the following workflow topics:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Prepare</strong>: Prior to analysis, it’s critical to understand the context and data sources you’re working with so you can formulate useful and answerable questions. You’ll also need to set up a “Project” for our walkthrough.</li>
<li><strong>Wrangle</strong>: Wrangling data entails the work of manipulating, cleaning, transforming, and merging data. In section 2 we focus on reading, reducing, and tidying our data.</li>
<li><strong>Explore</strong>: In section 3, we use simple summary statistics, more sophisticated approaches like term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf), and basic data visualization to explore our data and see what insight it provides in response to our question.</li>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="prepare">1. PREPARE</h2>
<p>Prior to analysis, it’s critical to understand the context and data sources available so you can formulate useful questions that can be feasibly addressed by your data. For this section, we’ll focus on the following topics:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><strong>Context</strong>. We learn a little bit about the North Carolina Race to the Top grant and the evaluation of the online professional development work, including questions and findings from the 2012 report.</li>
<li><strong>Questions.</strong> What aspects of online professional development offerings do <strong>teachers</strong> find most valuable?</li>
<li><strong>Project Setup.</strong> We visit Chapter 6 from DSIEUR to set up a Project in RStudio and R script for analysis.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a.-some-context">1a. Some Context</h3>
<section id="rtt-online-professional-development-evaluation" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="rtt-online-professional-development-evaluation">RTT Online Professional Development Evaluation</h4>
<p><img src="img/opd.png" class="img-fluid" style="width:30.0%"></p>
<p>North Carolina was one of 12 recipients of the 2010 federal Race to the Top (RttT) grants, bringing nearly $400 million to the state’s public school system. Over the course of four years, NC’s RttT coordinated a set of activities and policy reforms designed to collectively improve the performances of students, teachers, leaders, and schools.</p>
<p>The North Carolina Race to the Top (RttT) proposal (North Carolina Office of the Governor, 2010) specifies that the state’s Professional Development Initiative will focus on the “use of e-learning tools to meet the professional development needs of teachers, schools, and districts” (p.&nbsp;191). It points to research demonstrating that “well-designed and -implemented online professional development programs are not only valued by teachers but also positively impact classroom practices and student learning.”</p>
<p><strong>Data Source &amp; Analysis</strong></p>
<p>The evaluation used a wide range of data sources including interviews, document review, site analytics, and surveys, which we’ll focus on for this walkthrough. Survey protocols were designed in cooperation with NCDPI to systematically collect information about local professional development, state-level supports, use of available RttT professional development resources, and organizational and classroom practices in the schools, which will serve as a baseline to assess changes over the period of the North Carolina RttT initiatives.</p>
<p>Quantitative analyses focused primarily on descriptive analysis of item-level responses. In addition, quantitative data from these surveys were analyzed to examine patterns in responses by participants’ role, event type (e.g., module, webinar, resource), and region. Responses to open-ended survey items of the Online Resources Survey were manually coded by their relation to each Learning Forward professional development standard.</p>
<p>Note that the dataset we’ll be using for analysis in this walkthrough is exported as is from Qualtrics with personal identifiers, select demographics, metadata, and closed-ended responses removed.</p>
<p><strong>Summary of Findings</strong></p>
<p>Approximately half of the state’s educators completed at least one online module by the end of the 2011-12 school year. Overall, most participants agreed that the webinars and modules were relevant to their professional development needs, though some content was redundant with prior PD activities and not always content- or grade-specific, and some modules did not meet national standards. Most online modules were completed independently and not in Professional Learning Community groups.</p>
<p>A common theme from focus groups and open-ended survey responses was the <strong>convenience</strong> of online professional development. One teacher in a focus group stated, “I liked the format. And the way that it was given, it was at your own pace, which works well for our schedules…” Educators also frequently cited that the <strong>information and resources</strong> provided through the modules improved their understanding of the new standards and the teacher evaluation process. Webinar participants appreciated the useful, updated information presented through a combination of PowerPoint slides and <strong>video clips</strong>.</p>
<p>While the majority of educators have indicated their satisfaction with these resources, the findings suggest that the use of these resources at both the state and local level was not wholly consistent with national standards for online professional development. Many LEAs likely needed additional guidance, training, support, technology tools, and/or content resources to ensure that local efforts contribute to the quality of the experiences for educators and that the vision for online professional development outlined in the state’s RttT proposal is realized and can be sustained beyond RttT.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="b.-guiding-questions" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="b.-guiding-questions">1b. Guiding Questions</h3>
<p>The State’s progress on designing and implementing online professional development was originally guided by the following (very) general evaluation questions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>State Strategies: To what extent did the state implement and support proposed RttT professional development efforts?</li>
<li>Short-Term Outcomes: What were direct outcomes of state-level RttT professional development efforts?</li>
</ol>
<p>For this walkthrough, we’ll use text mining to complement prior qualitative analyses conducted as part of the RttT Evaluation by examining responses to open-ended questions on the RttT Online PD Survey administered to over 15,000 NC educators.</p>
<p>Our (very) specific questions of interest for this walkthrough are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>What aspects of online professional development offerings do <em>teachers</em> find most valuable?</strong></li>
<li><strong>How might resources differ in the value they afford teachers?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, one overarching question we’ll explore throughout this lab, and that Silge and Robinson (2018) identify as a central question to text mining and natural language processing, is:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>How do we <strong>quantify</strong> what a document or collection of documents is about?</p>
</blockquote>
</section>
<section id="c.-set-up-a-project" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="c.-set-up-a-project">1c. Set Up a Project</h3>
<p>As highlighted in Chapter 6 of Data Science in Education Using R (DSIEUR), one of the first steps of every workflow should be to set up a “Project” within RStudio. This will be your “home” for any files and code used or created in Lab 1. Open RStudio and follow these steps from DESIUR 6.6 to create a Project for Lab 1:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Click on “File”</li>
<li>Select “New Project”</li>
<li>Choose “New Directory”</li>
<li>Click on “New Project”</li>
<li>Enter your Project’s name in the box that says, “Directory name”. Choose a Project name that helps you remember that this is a project is part of Lab 1: Tidy Text &amp; Word Counts. Avoid using spaces in your Project name, and instead, separate words with hyphens or underscore characters.</li>
<li>Choose where to save your Project by clicking on “Browse” next to the box labeled “Create project as a subdirectory of:”. If you are just using this to learn and test out creating a Project, consider placing it in your downloads or another temporary directory so that you remember to remove it later.</li>
<li>Click “Create Project”</li>
</ol>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="img/file.png" class="img-fluid figure-img" style="width:40.0%"></p>
<figcaption>Create New File</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Now that you have a Project to store .R scripts that you create as you work through this lab, let’s create our first .R script:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Click on “File”</li>
<li>Select “R script”</li>
<li>Click the disk icon or select “Save” from file menu to save.</li>
<li>Enter a file name. See the <a href="https://style.tidyverse.org/files.html#names">R Style Guide</a> for standard file naming conventions.</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, using your newly created R script, type the following code to load the packages that we’ll be needing for this walkthrough.</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co"># Install necessary libraries</span></span>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="wrangle">2. WRANGLE</h2>
<p>In general, data wrangling involves some combination of cleaning, reshaping, transforming, and merging data (Wickham &amp; Grolemund, 2017). The importance of data wrangling is difficult to overstate, as it involves the initial steps of going from raw data to a dataset that can be explored and modeled (Krumm et al, 2018).</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><strong>Reading Data</strong>. Before working with data, we need to “read” it into R. It also helps to inspect your data</li>
<li><strong>Data Reduction</strong>. We focus on tools from the <code>dplyr</code> package to view, <code>rename</code>, select, slice, and filter our data in preparation for analysis.</li>
<li><strong>Tidy Text</strong>. We’ll learn how to use the <code>tidytext</code> package to both “tidy” and tokenize our text in order to create a data frame to use for analysis.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a.-read-view-write-data">2a. Read, View, Write Data</h3>
<p>The Reading Data section introduces the following functions for reading data into R and inspecting it’s contents:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>dplyr::read_csv()</code> Reading .csv files into R.</li>
<li><code>base::print()</code> View your data frame in the Console Pane</li>
<li><code>utils::view()</code> View your data frame in the Source Pane</li>
<li><code>tibble::glimpse()</code> Like print, but transposed so you can see all columns</li>
<li><code>utils::head()</code> View the first 6 rows of your data.</li>
<li><code>utils::tail()</code> View last 6 rows of your data.</li>
<li><code>dplyr::write_csv()</code> writing .csv files to directory.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember, the name before the double colon indicates the package the function comes from. For example, <code>read_csv</code> comes from the `readr`` package.</p>
<section id="reading-data-into-r" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="reading-data-into-r">Reading Data into R</h4>
<p>To get started, we need to import, or “read”, our data into R. The function used to import your data will depend on the file format of the data you are trying to import.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Download the <code>opd_survey.csv</code> file we’ll be using for this Lab from our github.</li>
<li>Create a folder in directory on your computer where you stored your R Project and name it “data”.</li>
<li>Add the file to your data folder.</li>
<li>Check your Files tab in R Studio to verify that your file is indeed in your data folder.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now let’s read our data into our Environment and assign it to a variable name so we can work with it like any other object in R.</p>

</div>
<p>Notice that <code>read_csv()</code> dealt with the issues of duplicate column names for us!!</p>
<p>If you happen to run into issues with data import, RStudio as has an Import Dataset feature for a point and click approach to adding data to your environment.</p>

<section id="b.-reduce-data" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="b.-reduce-data">2b. Reduce Data</h3>
<p>As you’ve probably already noticed from viewing our dataset, we clearly have more data than we need to answer our rather basic research question. For this part of our workflow we focus on the following functions from the <a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org"><code>dplyr</code> package</a> for wrangling our data:</p>
<p><a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org"><strong><code>dplyr</code></strong></a> <strong>functions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><code>select()</code> picks variables based on their names.</li>
<li><code>slice()</code> lets you select, remove, and duplicate rows.</li>
<li><code>rename()</code> changes the names of individual variables using new_name = old_name syntax</li>
<li><code>filter()</code> picks cases, or rows, based on their values in a specified column.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href=""><strong><code>stats</code></strong></a> <strong>functions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><code>na.omit()</code> a handy little function from the <code>stats</code> package for removing rows with missing values, i.e.&nbsp;NA.</li>
</ul>
<section id="subset-columns" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="subset-columns">Subset Columns</h4>
<p>To begin, let’s <code>select()</code> Role, Resources (named as Resource…6 in the data frame), and Q21 columns and store as new data frame since those respectively pertain to educator role, OPD resource they are evaluating, and, as illustrated by the second row,</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb9"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb9-1"><a href="#cb9-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">colnames</span>(opd_survey)[<span class="dv">6</span>] <span class="ot">=</span><span class="st">"Resource"</span></span>

</div>
<p>Notice that like the bulk of all tidyverse functions, the first input <code>select()</code> expects is a data frame, followed by the columns you’d like to select.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at our newly created data frame that should have dramatically fewer variables:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb10"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb10-1"><a href="#cb10-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">head</span>(opd_selected)</span></code><button title="Copy to Clipboard" class="code-copy-button"><i class="bi"></i></button></pre></div>

<section id="rename-columns" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="rename-columns">Rename Columns</h4>
<p>Notice that Q21 is not a terribly informative variable name. Let’s now take our <code>opd_selected</code> data frame and use the <code>rename()</code> function along with the <code>=</code> assignment operator to change the name from Q21 to “text” and save it as <code>opd_renamed</code>.</p>
<p>This naming is somewhat intentional because it not only is it the text we are interested in analyzing, but also mirrors the naming conventions in our [Text Mining with R]<a href="https://www.tidytextmining.com/tidytext.html" class="uri">https://www.tidytextmining.com/tidytext.html</a> book and will make it easier to follow the examples there.</p>

<p>Now let’s deal with the legacy rows that Qualtrics outputs by default, which are effectively 3 sets of headers. We will use the <code>slice()</code> function, which is basically the same as the <code>select()</code> function but for rows instead of columns, to carve out those two rows.</p>

<p>For this part of our workflow we focus on the following functions from the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidytext/"><code>tidytext</code></a> and <code>dplyr</code> packages respectively:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>unnest_tokens()</code> splits a column into tokens</li>
<li><code>anti_join()</code> returns all rows from x without a match in y.</li>
</ul>
<section id="tidy-data-principles" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="tidy-data-principles">Tidy Data Principles</h4>
<p>Not surprisingly, the Tidyverse set of packages including packages like <code>dplyr</code> adhere “tidy” data principles <a href="https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v021i12">(Wickham 2014)</a>. Tidy data has a specific structure:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each variable is a column</li>
<li>Each observation is a row</li>
<li>Each type of observational unit is a table</li>
</ul>
<p>Why would this data be considered “untidy”?</p>
<p><img src="img/untidy.png" class="img-fluid" style="width:100.0%"></p>
<p>Text data, by it’s very nature is ESPECIALLY untidy. In <a href="https://www.tidytextmining.com/tidytext.html">Chapter 1 of Text Mining with R</a>, Silge and Robinson define the tidy text format as</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><small><strong>a table with one-token-per-row</strong>. A token is a meaningful unit of text, such as a word, that we are interested in using for analysis, and tokenization is the process of splitting text into tokens. This one-token-per-row structure is in contrast to the ways text is often stored in current analyses, perhaps as strings or in a document-term matrix. For tidy text mining, the <strong>token</strong> that is stored in each row is most often a single word, but can also be an n-gram, sentence, or paragraph. In the tidytext package, we provide functionality to tokenize by commonly used units of text like these and convert to a one-term-per-row format.</small></p>

<p>There is A LOT to unpack with this function. First notice that <code>unnest_tokens</code> expects a data frame as the first argument, followed by two column names. The first is an output column name that doesn’t currently exist but will be created as the text is unnested into it (<code>word</code>, in this case). This if followed by the input column that the text comes from which we uncreatively named <code>text</code>. Also notice:</p>
<ul>
<li>Other columns, such as <code>Role</code> and <code>Resource</code>, are retained.</li>
<li>All punctuation has been removed.</li>
<li>Tokens have been changed to lowercase, which makes them easier to compare or combine with other datasets. However, we can use the <code>to_lower = FALSE</code> argument to turn off this behavior).</li>
</ul>

<section id="remove-stop-words" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="remove-stop-words">Remove Stop Words</h4>
<p>One final step in tidying our text is to remove words that don’t add much value to our analysis (at least when using this approach) such as “and”, “the”, “of”, “to” etc. The <code>tidytext</code> package contains a <code>stop_words</code> dataset derived from three different lexicons that we’ll use to remove rows that match words in this dataset.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at these common stop words so we know what we’re getting rid of from our <code>opd_tidy</code> dataset.</p>

</div>
<p>In order to remove these stop words, we will use function called <code>anti_join()</code> that looks for matching values in a specific column from two datasets and returns rows from the original dataset that have no matches. For a good overview of the different <code>dplyr</code> joins see here: <a href="https://medium.com/the-codehub/beginners-guide-to-using-joins-in-r-682fc9b1f119" class="uri">https://medium.com/the-codehub/beginners-guide-to-using-joins-in-r-682fc9b1f119</a></p>

<p>Let’s remove rows from our <code>opd_tidy</code> data frame that contain matches in the <code>word</code> column with those in the <code>stop_words</code> dataset and save it as <code>opd_clean</code> since we were done cleaning our data at this point.</p>

<p>As highlighted in both DSEIUR and Learning Analytics Goes to School, calculating summary statistics, data visualization, and feature engineering (the process of creating new variables from a dataset) are a key part of exploratory data analysis. One goal in this phase is explore questions that drove the original analysis and develop new questions and hypotheses to test in later stages. In Section 3, we will calculate some very basic summary statistics from our tidied text, explore key words of interest to gather additional context, and use data visualization to identify patterns and trends that may not be obvious from our tables and numerical summaries. Topics addressed in Section 3 include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Summary Stats</strong>. We focus primarily on the use of word counts and calculating proportions to to help us identify common words used to describe the most valuable aspects of online professional development offerings.</li>
<li><strong>Word Search</strong>. We learn about the global regular expression parser, or <code>grep</code> package in R, to search for key words among our data set.</li>
<li><strong>Data Visualization</strong>. Finally, we wrap up this walk through by creating wordclouds, bar plots, and small multiple charts to explore patterns and trends that would be difficult to distinguish otherwise.</li>

<p>In this section, we introduce the following functions:</p>
<p><a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org"><strong><code>dplyr</code></strong></a> <strong>functions</strong></p>
<ul>

<p>Now that we have our original survey data in a tidy text format, we can use the <code>count()</code> function from the <code>dplyr</code> package to find the most common words used by teachers when asked, “What was the most beneficial/valuable aspect of this online resource?”</p>

<p>One notable distinction between word counts and more traditional qualitative analysis is that broader themes like “convenience” often are not immediately apparent in word counts, but rather emerges from responses containing words like “pace”, “format”, “online”, “ease”, and “access”.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>A common theme from focus groups and open-ended survey responses was the <strong>convenience</strong> of online professional development. One teacher in a focus group stated, “I liked the format. And the way that it was given, it was at your own pace, which works well for our schedules…”</p>

<p>The <code>count()</code> function can also be used with more than one column to count the frequency a word occurs for a select <code>Resource</code> in our dataset.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="word-frequencies">Word Frequencies</h4>
<p>One common approach to facilitate comparison across documents or groups of text, in our case responses by Online Resource type, is by looking at the frequency that each word occurs among all words for that document group. This also helps to better gauge how prominent the same word is across different groups.</p>
<p>For example, let’s create counts for each <code>Resource</code> and <code>word</code> paring, and then create a new column using the <code>mutate()</code> function that calculations the proportion that word makes up among all words.</p>
<p>To do this a little more efficiently, I’m going to use the %&gt;% operator:</p>

<section id="term-frequency-inverse-document-frequency" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="term-frequency-inverse-document-frequency">Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency</h4>
<p>Term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf) is an approach that takes this approach one step further.</p>
<p>As noted in <a href="https://www.tidytextmining.com/tfidf.html">Tidy Text Mining with R</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The statistic tf-idf is intended to measure how important a word is to a document in a collection (or corpus) of documents, for example, to one novel in a collection of novels or to one website in a collection of websites.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Silge and Robinson note that, “The idea of tf-idf is to find the important words for the content of each document by decreasing the weight for commonly used words and increasing the weight for words that are not used very much in a collection or corpus of document… That is, tf-idf attempts to find the words that are important (i.e., common) in a text, but not too common.”</p>
<p>The <code>tidytext</code> package has a function called <code>bind_tf_idf()</code> that takes a tidy text dataset as input with one row per token (term), per document. One column (word here) contains the terms/tokens, one column contains the documents (book in this case), and the last necessary column contains the counts, how many times each document contains each term (n in this example).</p>
<p>Because tf-idf can account through weighting for “too common” words like “and” or “but”, when calculating tf-idf it is not necessary to remove stop words. However, we will need add a column for total words for each <code>Resource</code> type which can be accomplished in a couple of steps.</p>
<p>First, let’s recycle our <code>opd_teacher</code> data frame and calculate counts for each word again, but this time instead of word counts for the total data set, we’ll calculate word counts for each ‘Resource’.</p>

<p>Notice that idf and thus tf-idf are zero for these extremely common words (typically stop words). These are all words that appear in teacher responses for all online resource types, so the idf term (which will then be the natural log of 1) is zero. T<strong>he inverse document frequency (and thus tf-idf) is very low (near zero) for words that occur in many of the documents in a collection</strong>; this is how this approach decreases the weight for common words. The inverse document frequency will be a higher number for words that occur in fewer of the documents in the collection.</p>

<p>In some cases, we can see that the use of the word “online” was simply repetition of the question prompt, but in other cases we can see that it’s associated with the broader theme of “convenience” as with the quote, “This online resources gave me the opportunity to study on my own time.”</p>
<p>Note that you can also use regular express operators with <code>grep</code> like the <code>*</code> operator to search for word stems. For example using <code>inform*</code> in our search will return quotes with “inform”, “informative”, “information”, etc.</p>

Hadley Wickham’s <a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html">R for Data Science</a> and [ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data] are also great introductions to data visualization in R with ggplot2.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="small-multiples">Small Multiples</h4>
<p>Word clouds and bar charts are pretty effective for highlighting the most common words in an entire corpus, or in our case, all teacher survey responses, regardless of resource type being reviewed.</p>
<p>One limitation we ran into earlier when we started looking at word frequencies and tf-idf stats was that it was difficult to easily compare the most common or unique words for each resource type. That is where small multiples come. A small multiple is basically a series of similar graphs or charts using the same scale and axes that make it easier to compare across different document collections of interest, in our case, word counts by resource type.</p>
<p>Let’s use the example illustrated in Text Mining with R to create a small multiple for our <code>opd_frequencies</code> data set instead of the <code>opd_tf_idf</code></p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="model">4. MODEL</h2>
<p>As highlighted in <a href="https://datascienceineducation.com/c03.html">Chapter 3 of Data Science in Education Using R</a>, the <strong>Model</strong> step of the data science process entails “using statistical models, from simple to complex, to understand trends and patterns in the data.” The authors note that while descriptive statistics and data visualization during the <strong>Explore</strong> step can help us to identify patterns and relationships in our data, statistical models can be used to help us determine if relationships, patterns and trends are actually meaningful.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://catalog.lib.ncsu.edu/catalog/NCSU4862134">Learning Analytics Goes to School</a>, the authors describe modeling as simply developing a mathematical summary of a dataset and note that there are two general types to modeling: unsupervised and supervised learning. Unsupervised learning algorithms, which will be the focus in this lab, are used to explore the structure of a dataset, while supervised models “help to quantify relationships between features and a known outcome.”</p>
<p>We will explore the use of models for text mining in future labs, but if you are interested in looking ahead to see how they might be applied to text as data, I recommend taking a look at <a href="https://www.tidytextmining.com/topicmodeling.html">Chapter 6 Topic Modeling</a> from Text Mining with R: A Tidy Approach. Chris Bail in his Text as Data course also provides a nice introduction to Topic Modeling, including Structural Topic Modeling, which we will explore using the <code>stm</code> package in future labs.</p>
<p>Finally, if you have not already done so, I ask that at minimum you read Chapter 3 of DSIEUR as well as the section on the Data-Intensive Research Workflow from Chapter 2 of Learning Analytics Goes to school.</p>

<section id="communicate" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="communicate">5. COMMUNICATE</h2>
<p>The final(ish) step in our workflow/process is sharing the results of analysis with wider audience. Krumm et al.&nbsp;(2018) have outline the following 3-step process for communicating with education stakeholders what you have learned through analysis:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Select</strong>. Communicating what one has learned involves selecting among those analyses that are most important and most useful to an intended audience, as well as selecting a form for displaying that information, such as a graph or table in static or interactive form, i.e.&nbsp;a “data product.”</li>
<li><strong>Polish</strong>. After creating initial versions of data products, research teams often spend time refining or polishing them, by adding or editing titles, labels, and notations and by working with colors and shapes to highlight key points.</li>
<li><strong>Narrate</strong>. Writing a narrative to accompany the data products involves, at a minimum, pairing a data product with its related research question, describing how best to interpret the data product, and explaining the ways in which the data product helps answer the research question.</li>
</ol>
<p>In this particular walkthrough, our target audience is developers of online professional learning opportunities who are looking to receive feedback on what’s working well and potential areas for improvement. This lets us assume a good deal of prior knowledge on their end about the context of the evaluation, a high level of familiarly with the online professional development resources being assessed, and fairly literate at reading and interpreting data and charts. This also lets us simplify our data products and narrative and reduce the level of detail needed to communicate useful information.</p>
<p>For summative evaluation, typically at the end of a school year or grant period when the emphasis is on assessing program outcomes and impact, our audience would extend to those less familiar with the program but with a vested interest in program’s success, such as the NC State Board of Education or those directly impacted by the program including NC educators is general. In that case, our data product would need to include much more narrative to provide context and greater detail in charts and graphs in order to help interpret the data presented.</p>
<section id="a.-select" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a.-select">5a. Select</h3>
<section id="analyses" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="analyses"><strong>Analyses</strong></h4>
<p>For analyses to present, I’m going to focus primarily on:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Word Counts</strong>. One of the first things I’ll share with my audience is my analysis of word counts since these are very easy to interpret and will provide online PD developers with some instant insight.</li>
<li><strong>Word Search</strong>. I also think it’s important to include some actual participant responses for select key words in order to provide additional information about how those words are being used on context. I may handpick some select quotes or present a random selection of quotes.</li>
<li><strong>TF-IDF</strong>. Finally, as a way to potentially help them weed through words unique to specific resources, as well as potentially identify some areas for potential follow-up and to dig deeper, I’ll discuss</li>
</ol>
<p>I’ve decided to exclude analyses of just term frequency because I feel like simply counts are easier to quickly interpret while tf-idf provides more nuance. I also want to be careful not to overwhelm my audience.</p>
</section>
<section id="data-products" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-products"><strong>Data Products</strong></h4>
<p>In terms of “data products” and form, and because this is a simple demonstration for sharing analyses and our first experience in this lab with independently analysis, I’ll prepare my data product as a basic slide show that includes the following charts:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Word Cloud</strong>. This is really as much decorative as it is a means to communicate key findings. I’ll probably include this on my title slide as a way to immediately engage my audience and provide a preview of findings I’ll share. It’s also a way to include common words that may not make the cut in my bar chart.</li>
<li><strong>Bar Chart</strong>. I’ll definitely share with them the bar chart I created earlier as a means to focus on the most common words used by teachers across all resources. Also, this is a little less busy than a word cloud and allows them to quickly see the top words in order.</li>
<li><strong>Quotes</strong>. As noted above, I also feel it’s important to provide some participants responses that help explain how the common words are being used in context.</li>
<li><strong>Small Multiples</strong>. Although at this point a little skeptical about how meaningful the tf-idf analysis was due to issues such as spelling as well as the limited number of responses for many resources, I think the small multiples chart will help to spark discussion among PD developers about specific aspects of each resource type that teachers’ value.</li>

<p>We’ll be using <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com">R Markdown</a> to create a slide deck or short report that documents our independent analysis. R Markdown files can also be used to create a <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/gallery.html">wide range of outputs and formats</a>, including polished PDF or Word documents, websites, web apps, journal articles, online books, interactive tutorials and more. And to make this process even more user-friendly, R Studio now includes <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/visual-markdown-editing/#/">a visual editor</a>! This lets you create R Markdown files like you would with a standard word processing tool.</p>
<p>An additional advantage of R Markdown compared to the alternative of copying and pasting tables and charts created from an R script to Word or PowerPoint is that you can embed your R code directly in your R Markdown file making it easy to updated your charts as needed and share your R Markdown file with others so they can inspect your code and reproduce your analysis, i.e.&nbsp;<a href="https://vickysteeves.gitlab.io/repro-papers/r-markdown-in-reproducible-research.html">reproducible research</a>.</p>

<p>To make the word cloud a little less busy and a little more useful, I removed the multitude of colors from the default setting, and using some modified code form the <code>?wordclouds2</code> help file, I’ve included an argument in the <code>wordclouds2( )</code> function to use the color black for words that occur more than 1000 times, and gray for the rest.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="bar-chart">Bar Chart</h4>
<p>For my bar chart, I did some minor clean up, including editing the x-axis title, removing the redundant y axis by setting it to <code>NULL</code>, and adding a title. I also used the built-in <code>theme_minimal( )</code> function layer to simplify the look. If this were something for a more formal report, I’d probably finesse it even more, but it gets the point across.</p>

<p>Finally, two related issues that I want to clean up a little with respect to tf-idf before sharing with an outside audience are the appearance of stop words and too few responses for the Calendar online learning resources.</p>
<p>First, I’ll reuse my <code>opd_clean</code> data frame which had my stop words removed to create my new <code>opd_tf_idf</code> data frame.</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb60"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb60-1"><a href="#cb60-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>opd_resource_counts <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> opd_clean <span class="sc">%&gt;%</span></span>

<p>Then I’ll use the <code>filter()</code> function to remove any response pertaining to Calendar and add some labels using the <code>labs()</code> function. Again, if this were a chart destined for a more formal report, I’d also clean up the Resource names to make them more readable and fit properly on each bar plot.</p>
<p>Finally, with the help of <a href="https://twitter.com/sorayaworldwide">Soraya Campbell</a>, I’ve fixed the pesky issue with the charts not ordering by tf-idf value properly by changing <code>Resource</code> from a character to a factor and using the <code>reorder_within</code> function.</p>
