## Discuss

Take a look at the dataset located [here](https://github.com/laser-institute/text-mining/tree/main/dataset) and consider the following:

\- What format is this data set stored as?

\- What are some things you notice about this dataset?

\- What questions do you have about this dataset?

\- What similar dataset do you have?

\- What research questions do you want to address with your dataset?

## Word Count

-   Review 1: This movie is very scary and long

-   Review 2: This movie is not scary and is slow

-   Review 3: This movie is spooky and good

## Term frequency

The number we fill the matrix with are simply the raw count of the tokens in each document. This is called the term frequency (TF) approach.

## IDF, TF-IDF

IDF is a measure of how important a term is. TF-IDF is intended to measure how important a word is to a document in a collection (or corpus) of documents.

# Part 2: R Code Along

Tokenization, Stemming, Stopword, and Filter

\[Text Mining_Basics\]

## Tokenization, Stemming, Stopword, and Filter

These are some of the methods of processing the data in text mining:

-   unnest_tokens()
-   wordStem() (lab 3)
-   anti_join(dataframe, stop_words)
-   filter()
