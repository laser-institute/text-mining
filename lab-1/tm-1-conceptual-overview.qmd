## Turn text into numbers

Some common techniques used for converting textual data into numerical representations:

-   word count
-   term frequency
-   inverse document frequency
-   TF-IDF

## Word count
-   Review 1: This movie is very scary and long
-   Review 2: This movie is not scary and is slow
-   Review 3: This movie is spooky and good

## Term frequency
The number we fill the matrix with are simply the raw count of the tokens in each document. This is called the term frequency (TF) approach.

## IDF, TF-IDF
IDF is a measure of how important a term is. TF-IDF is intended to measure how important a word is to a document in a collection (or corpus) of documents.

## Tokenization, Stemming, Stopword
-   Tokenization is the process of breaking down a text document or input into smaller units, typically words or phrases, known as tokens.
-   Stemming is a technique used in text processing to reduce words to their root or base form, known as the stem.
-   Stopwords are common words that are filtered out or excluded from text data during text processing because they typically do not carry significant meaning or contribute much to the understanding of the text.
