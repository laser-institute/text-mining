# Part 1: Research Overview

Applying Topic Modeling in STEM Education Research

## What is Topic Modeling?

"Topic modeling is a field of natural language processing that aims to extract themes by text mining a set of documents." (Blei, 2012; Vijayan, 2021)

## Research Questions

::: panel-tabset
## Literature

Literature review (e.g., Chen et al., 2020) - In what research topics were the Computers & Education community interested ? - How did such research topics evolve over time?

Assessment (e.g., Ming & Ming, 2015) - Do the concepts discussed by students as inferred by pLSA (Probabilistic latent semantic analysis) predict their course outcomes? - How does the accuracy of these predictions change over time as more student work is analyzed?

## Walkthrough example

Course/project evaluation (e.g., Akoglu et al., 2019) - What are the similarities and differences between how PLT (professional learning team) members and Non-PLT online participants engage and meet course goals in a MOOC-Ed designed for educators?

## Discuss

Take a look at the dataset located [here](https://github.com/yan2014/TM_LASER/tree/main/data-u) and consider the following:

\- What format is this data set stored as?

\- What are some things you notice about this dataset?

\- What questions do you have about this dataset?

\- What similar dataset do you have?

\- What research questions do you want to address with your dataset?

## What are limitations & ethical considerations?

-   Nuances of language or context may be lost
-   Limited to source material selected by researcher(s)
-   Not good for small corpora
-   “Computing probabilities allows a "generative" process by which a collection of new “synthetic documents” can be generated that would closely reflect the statistical characteristics of the original collection” (Wikipedia).
