I think it's something that will interest the students and it can demonstrate nicely how confidence intervals and hypothesis tests can reflect real life data.

However the data set was qualitative with minimal variables and I was not impressed with the method for conducting the investigation.   I think that it would be more valid for students to develop their own investigative proposal (including posing a question that they want to answer within  the confines of Coke vs. Pepsi).     After watching the presenter's videos I see a much greater correlation between scientific processes and statistical methods.  The entire investigative process needs to be modeled at each step and students need to learn through experimenting with their own investigations.  We are attempting to do this with all of our Chemistry Labs this year.

Both the others are also good although it is data that is collected individually and/or hypothetically whereas the Coke/Pepsi thing was really a fun activity  an event where everybody was actively involved. Also the collected data was something that the students could own up to because they were instrumental in not only collecting the data  but also in actually making the data happen.

The last task is very simple: just to look at the dotplot and arrive to an evident conclusion. The first one instruct the students to calculate the coefficients by hand. I really don't see the point on doing such calculations by hand when there are many technological tools available for our use. I always like to teach my students first the algorithms and calculations by hand but then right away we get to technology  mostly the TI84 since it is the one I have a class set available. The coke and Pepsi activity is definitely the one that allow more critical thinking  discussion and sharing among the students.

This study can even be done in middle school. Teachers are working with student interest which will keep them engaged throughout the entire lesson. There is movement throughout the classroom  conversations among students. and then a final comparison with the entire class. This is something I would absolutely do with my future students.

For that reason  I think the Pepsi vs Coke Approach is productive. I suggest that this activity could be improved by having students create a \""fictitious\"" release form so that every student who drinks the Pepsi or the Coke signs the consent form agreeing to participate. After all in all experimental studies this is what needs to be done. This is just a suggestion. """

It could  however  get some serious upgrades!  I didn't particularly think that any of the three were great activities.  The Pepsi vs Coke idea is a good one and good place to start  but you could incorporate a lot more of the Investigation Cycle to make it a really in depth and great activity.  The students could pose a question in their own words using their own understanding.  They could come up with the data collection method and have to explain why it the data collected is fair and unbiased  why it takes care of any what ifs  etc.  Then they could do a lot with the data they collected.  They could then come up with a final statement/inference based on their data with description of some of the what ifs and uncertainties.

It allows students to actually gather their data  and then analyze it. In this experiment  they are active participants in their own learning. In contrast  feel the first and third activity just asks students to answer simple questions.

I learned more in setting up the experiment.  I did the experiment on the first day of class  because I was really excited about experimentation and statistics.  The suggestion came from a colleague at a workshop  so I set up the experiment using randomization and 3 cups.  I labeled the \dixie cups\"" 1A 1B 1C. 2A 2B 2C etc.  I had enough for every student.   Everything was set to go and my first period did the experiment and we got results  showing that they could have done just as well by chance.  Second period came and we did it again and had about the same results.  Then I was cleaning up and tried a left over set.  The water tasted like \""sharpie\""!  They all tasted like sharpie and not a single student said anything to me!  I poured the water in another glass and it tasted normal.  The next day we talked about problems in designing an experiment  when I asked them what one problem  may have been... they mentioned the marker. Hah! """

We are generally given predefined models and asked to plug in data and analysis the results. This practical experience is pretty valuable. The familiarity gained by plugging in the numbers is valuable  so is familiarity in applied statistics with seemingly scary equations. Many students need confidence which is achieved in this simple exercise. Also  in todays' classes we don't seem to be doing the large amount of repetition that I was subjected to when I was young  and that repetition was key to my ability to recall the skills decades later. Finally  there are plenty of questions that can be explored in the setup of the problem  with opportunity to critically think. Again  as this exercise is pretty real-world  the critical thinking and questioning is extremely valuable.   The Coke Pepsi Challenge has been covered by numerous others  I agree with most--especially with the trouble of how much time is involved.   Television time is short  sweet and loaded with learning. As someone above said  polling themselves would add to this exercise  as would questioning why there is a difference and how we could go about finding out. I also think the graphic is awful  having the students experiment with different ways at displaying the data would also be very real-world. Much of real world statistics has to do with displaying data to non-statisticians  and how to show a story with data that is lacking. This exercise offers a lot of discussion topics.  So  I'll agree  mostly that there isn't much of a comparison  but I think practically the race is closer than we are giving credit to. Sometimes the best learning is in the bad examples  rather than in the good ones. I'm all for teaching  but I'm also for hands on experience that actually means something.

I'm now thinking about doing something similar comparing name brand products with store brands.   I'm not sure what yet - something that won't get spilled (I'll be teaching in an auditorium) - perhaps tortilla or potato chips.

It involves the students and allows them to generate their own data. It might be important to distinguish between nominal and continuous data for this exercise and how we determine confidence intervals based on the type of data.  The other exercises are also good in that they apply other concepts. This exposes students to different analytical tools also in a real world application. I always like modeling and predicting based on actual data.

I feel that if and when I conduct this task with my students  that I will have them propose their own method of figuring out what is the best method to use. I still would give them the option you presented but I would encourage them to think outside the box and do it their way as long as they use statiscal methods. This way I can get a better understanding of how they think and analyze situations or tasks.

I agree with the notion that the students could experience the range of pose  collect  analyze  interpret with this project.  The collection is fun  interesting  and engaging and I feel that this experiment can be capable of as much rigor as task 1 dealing with MPG  which I thought was the second most meaningfully engaging task.  Here  is where I really feel is the key  the students are more apt to participate  make the learning their own  pair and share with the Pepsi vs Coke challenge.  That alone would make it the most meaningful task to engage the students in the subjects  and then everything else is icing on the cake.  Pose the question on who can use their data  how these experiments are done in the outside world  who would pay for this data.  Let the collection phase be fun  exciting  and a treat for the students.  Analyzing and Interpreting the data can allow for as much rigor as is called for  the experiment can be modified for Middle School as well as High School students.

There is so much data out there to give to students to analyse so this task is quite nice in the way it uses data the students have gathered themselves from a task they would no doubt find enjoyable. In terms of marking students work  it's so much easier to have the numerical 'answers' and know what the data is going to look like when you have a set of data you have given the students (as opposed to them collecting it themselves)  so I wonder if this is partly why some tasks steer clear of allowing students to collect their own data...

It would be an interesting extension to have students look through a few of the most common \mistakes\"" of Coke versus Pepsi challenges in the past (putting one in a red versus blue cup)  and have students analyze the relative ease with which we can accidentally allow confounding variables into our investigations. I also liked the TV Hours Watched activity (which may have involved students collecting their own data  or could be an extension); because it leads with meaningful questions  and leaves open the relevant statistics that students should start. Open-ended data sets allow students to think critically about the average  spread/variability in the data  and possibly work to think-pair-share - / brainstorm how and why these TV-watching patterns are different  leading to good followup questions. This activity could be extended to investigate similar questions in small partner-teams  moving students throughout the entire investigation cycle."""

I definitely agree that it is the best task here  and students should definitely pose the experiment themselves because that is a great way to review the whole entire statistical design and review before the AP exam or final exam.   The only issue that I have with these things is the time issue in a class. It can become very easy for a teacher (like myself) to feel the crunch of time  and just throw data at them to do problems because it is so easy. I really want to make sure to use activities like this to really engage my students. It is a simple and easy way to look at a problem. It is something that I am striving to do and get better at.

On the other hand  when students are asked to seek out and generate their own data  they also don't like to get off their seat  overwhelmed by the tasked  not knowing where to start  or how to start. Worse still  not wanting to go the extra distance to accomplish something. However  the exercise of the Coke versus Pepsi comparison  this is a perfect example of simple but effective way of generating interest from students. Several of their senses are utilized and they feel confident doing the exercise because of its simplicity.

I am also wondering if the actual soda in the investigation could overshadow the statistics and the data analysis in the task  especially if there is not a lot of time.

I already do an activity similar to this when in our probability unit. However  I loved adding the confidence interval aspect to it. I agree that if students can collect their own data they will get more out of the lesson than the teacher providing the data. You could add to the activity by letting the students do other drinks as well. My students in the past  have done powerade vs gatorade in similar flavors. Sprite vs Sierra Mist  Nesquick chocolate milk vs store brand. Letting them have the choice of what they drink too engages them in the activity.

It is also well that the materials are cost effective  and the whole set up (maybe with 4 groups working simultaneously) can be completed within one class time.

Those of us who have done if for a long time think  \""Oh  that's easy.  Just go do it.\""   But for someone who has no starting point of reference for gathering data  just go do it can be an insurmountable hurdle if no one takes the time to show them how to do it.   Hopefully  the later units will provide ideas for helping students with the \""how to gather data\"" question.  I teach graduate students and even graduate students are stumped by getting started with gathering data.

However  I do think that there is value in occasional activities similar to the Car Weight/Mileage -- the value that I see is not in the mechanics of the calculations  but in seeing relationships between the various quantities (in this case  between the slope of the regression line  the standard deviations  and the linear correlation coefficient).  I remember when I was learning about correlation  it seemed very odd to me that a weak correlation almost always went with a fairly small slope -- why is it so rare to have a weak correlation with a steep slope?  Then  when I encountered the formula given in this activity (b = r * s_y / s_x)  it made much more sense.  Like you  I like to have my students calculate a standard deviation by hand once or twice (with very small samples) because I do think that performing the calculations gives them a sense of what the standard deviation tells them about that sample.

But notice all the prerequisite skills it requires.  Not that that's bad  but it means having already covered things like confidence intervals and hypothesis testing.  Another drawback that I see is that it doesn't require students to pose their own question or design their own experiment.  Perhaps there could be some brainstorming activities as a class before handing this activity out.     I think there is a lot of merit to different statistical tasks that focus on only portions of the cycle.  I think it's ok to maybe have a day to brainstorm how to just pose a question.  Then another task the just focuses on how to gather data.  The other two tasks were mostly analysis  but there is certainly merit in having some tasks that only analyze data as well.  Of course we should have some tasks that integrate all 4 parts of the cycle  but I would argue that we cannot make every task that way.  So if the goal is to teach the analysis of the data  the other tasks are just fine.  If the goal is to engage in more of the cycle  then Coke vs Pepsi does that  but it still lacks the whole cycle.

We can't do investigations every day  but it is important having discussions about data collection and posing questions. I feel like maybe a reasonable goal for me is to have an investigation that does all 4 at the end of each unit  after we have covered the key topics and had different days discussing parts of the cycle.

In my opinion  this is the reason why we liked the Coke vs Pepsi task.  It helps us in engaging our students and think outside the box about different factors that might affect their results.  I notice that there are disagreements on letting students do these task or ask them to do their own.  I think this task should serve as a guide for students to engage in designing their own experiment and compare their decisions to their classmates decisions and discuss how they would do their classmates experiments different and the factors that might affect the results.

Coke is the better activity  <i>though</i> I can't help but think about how we would scale up the activity  how we could bring up discussions about market research and \steered\"" data collection  and how presentation is so key in the analysis of the data.  It is also important to ask questions such as \""is this experiment statistically significant?\"".  So much research out there draws conclusions without ever discussing the significance of results  and so many decisions are made based on experiments and data that are not statistically significant.

In Car weight and MPG and in Coke vs. Pepsi  the students are told exactly what to do in each step.  The television task  on the other hand  gives the data in a form that is not conducive to comparison and asks the students to compare the distributions.  To do this effectively  they need to decompose the dotplot into two dotplots or back-to-back dotplots.  And although Mr Jebson's students have both a higher mean and median of hours watching TV  Ms Lee's students have greater variability in their hours of watching TV.  The shapes of the distributions are also different:  the distribution Ms Lee's class appears to be skewed right while Mr Jebson's class appears to be reasonably symmetric.  None of this is obvious with the data displayed as given.   I do agree that the Coke vs. Pepsi task has the most potential for the entire investigative cycle  but it needs to be written in a way that the students design the experiment  analyze the results  and form their conclusions.

I see two ways in which activities could be modified - one is to leave the scenario fixed if it sounds engaging  and tweak the activity to be more complete. The TV one is a good example of that. The other way is to leave the activity part (more-or-less) fixed and tweak the scenario. So in my opinion the mpg example is a scenario rather divorced from many students' experience  but there would be a wealth of pairs of quantitative variables that students could measure  or access on the internet  and use to study regression lines. In another post I suggested things like the melting time of icecubes  or an example I have used in class several times is some pair of body measurements e.g. arm span and heightt.

I especially like that the students choose the graphical display  but then the displays of all of the groups are interpreted.  What if everyone chooses the same?  (I think it would be great for at least choose one graphical display that DOESN'T provide much insight and discuss why it doesn't.)  It would be improved by giving the students MORE choice in the \""Pose\"" and \""Collect\"" phases.  Do students even care about Old Faithful wait times  or is there another topic in which they have more interest?  Ask the STUDENTS ideas about how data could be collected and decide as a class the best method.  Why TELL them to do a random sampling?  They might come up with it on their own.

I also commented in there but liked to expand the concept further. When students are involved in an activity  they make it there own and really would make it worth their while. Hence when they actually made the data happen  being instrumental in not only choosing which brand to anonymously be named and tasted  to collating the results  the students learn how to make data collection impartial  objective and representative. Also  they see the process of good data collection by the randomness it was done  such that whatever result would really represent a preference for a brand without any prior bias.   So  the students learn to collect and collate data and results in as objective and unbiased manner  such that results are untainted and would truly represent a true preference and not a directed preference through a prior bias. Though it would take a lot of time  yet the lessons learned on how data is done and collected and collated was worth its while in the lesson it has rendered.

I think this experience is a good way to get students involved in the Statistical process. One thing that I think would help make this task even more meaningful is if students became involved in pondering about how to answer questions like the Coke/Pepsi one without introducing bias to their results. Thus instead of giving the students this pretty-well designed experiment  you can help them get to the point where they recognize why the blinding of study participants is important  etc. That is really my only critique of this task. I think it funnels the students into one way of approaching this statistical question. It is important that they understand why they are doing the things they are doing. One thing that may help would be to open it up to them to decide how best to figure out which soda is more preferred.

I often start my unit on sampling methods and design with my seniors by having them design both a survey and an experiment to choose our school's favorite potato chip. Each year we end up with completely different designs! To add even further to student-design with this activity  I'm interested in having them design and conduct the experiment well  then have them go back and design the experiment more poorly with given motivations. For example  if I work for Coke  how might I conduct the experiment so that we'll always prefer Coke?

I was pleasantly surprised to observe that these were tasks that any adult might encounter in day to day life.  Middle schoolers must be more advanced than I would have imagined.  good for them.    <span style=\line-height: 1.42857;\"">I thought the two examples (airport and geysers) both were instructive and were ordered appropriately.  The airport example will be the most accessible to middle school students  most of whom probably have been in airports and have real life experience with the phenomenon being studied.  The data  goals  and investigation tasks had obvious applications and in a specific order to this data.  The student would be able to to clearly determine which of the steps applied in a specific order and how to do the investigation.  Also  the example asked for specific graphical output of the data  which would reduce the students' confusion and uncertainty about what the \""right\"" graphical method would be.  This examples provides the students with straight-forward hands-on experience with data analysis to apply to tackle the next problem about the geysers.  </span>   The geyser example also has real life applications that would seem to be real and not abstract to the students but  importantly  the second example expanded upon the first example by asking the student to think independently about the sequence of data analysis tasks and the appropriate tasks to perform.  The example introduces the concept of performing data checking activities prior to analyzing the data--VERY important.  The example also requires discussing the output with others.  This introduces the topic of effective communication of data analyses in a manner that is understood by others.  The best statistical analysis is worthless if no one else understands what was done and what the results were. """

If the students could collect the data themselves and some additional data  like student grades  hours spent outside or doing other activities.  My school is a charter school focused on getting students into nursing programs.  I am always looking for ways for students to tie their work to health.

I too like the way that students will randomly analyse different sets of data for the same task and this will force them to make their own unique interpretation. During a class discussion comparing students results it would be really interesting when they have to tackle the issue of potentially significantly different results that would occur due to variability. None of the three tasks ask for students to collect their own data  so it would be interesting to see how the task can be extended to similar scenarios on a follow up activity (e.g. length of time between earthquakes of a certain magnitude).

I like your suggestion.  One way to also get students to think about the data collection phase when data is handed to them  might be to get them to explain how data was collected  what the measurements mean  and what issues they may anticipate could have happened in data collection.

I like how the dats collection method involved flipping a coin to determine which soda to pour in which glass  adding some randomness to the process.  One thing that struck me  though  is that I keep hearing in this MOOC that statistics is all about dealing with uncertainty  and in this activity  you were finding out the preferred soda of <b><span><i>every</i></span></b> person in the class.  So you really aren't using a <b>sample</b>  since you are surveying the entire population of the class.  It seems to me there is no uncertainty if \everyone\"" is part of the data collection.    This activity could definitely be extended to address the more challenging question of \""What is the preferred cola brand in our school?  In our town?  In our county?\""  What different types of data could be collected to answer those questions  other than just doing taste tests?  How would the sampling methods be different for each region (school  town  county)?  How would you organize the data differently for each scenario?

The Coke vs Pepsi challenge may not go down too well in the UK however  due to schools trying to promote healthy eating among the pupils! One way the task could be extended (by gathering relevant additional data) would be to consider whether the order of drinking each drink made any difference  for example did they tend to prefer the drink they took first or second? And what were the students' regular drinking habits  for example  were there any students who drank only one or the other  or who drank neither routinely? Did regular drinking habits influence their choice  and did the students try to identify which drink was which? Were there any students who had no preference between the two drinks?

The flipping of the coin kept it random which is always needed in a good study of any kind.  To create the uncertainty  the activity could be extended to the entire school.  They could sample all of the students with the same math teacher and then figure out the confidence intervals from there.  This would also create some uncertainty since it will not involve everyone in the school.  Or  as you suggested  the town or county.  I also liked your idea of showing some exemplar studies as well as some flawed ones.  I find that when you tell students that there is something wrong with a problem or study  they enjoy trying to figure out what the mistake is.

A group may be assigned to Coke and possibly have to create an advertisement to persuade the audience to buy Coke knowing that the majority likes Pepsi.  The other group could design an advertisement or commercial from the opposite perspective.

The first time that I taught the course  I found myself \""behind\"" after spending time to collect the data.  In an effort to catch up  I stayed with provided  friendly data sets.  I am seeking all input and help in developing a course that provides opportunities for engagement while teaching the required standards.  There is a place for friendly data sets; they are needed to develop skills and initial understandings. I feel as if I need to do an entire cycle with my students before sending them off to do their own.     """

The choice hinges on several competing demands I think - the time available is an obvious one. The learning outcomes that the teacher expects  and the learning  outcomes that the students expect are also important and the close together those are  the better.

What I would change would be to guide students in the investigation cycle process allowing them to come up with their own question to pose  and their own data to collect  analyze and interpret.

I imagine a way to make this a slightly healthier option would be to use Marmite and Vegemite (New Zealand) or maybe a premium vs a cheaper peanut butter.   The task is rather prescriptive and so I would modify this with some class discussion beforehand re: how we will carry out the test. When there is agreement on what to do I would make suggestions to fill any gaps such as mixing up the A and B allocations with a coin.   The Middle School geyser task is quite wordy but still useful as it introduces the idea of sampling.

This task is more mathematical based than statistical  because the students are focused on computing with little context.  However  I believe in doing computations by hand before learning them on the calculator and can see the benefits of the task.   To make it more statistical  here are my thoughts: Trucks are a big deal at my school and there's always arguments over chevy vs.ford vs. dodge. Realistically  we can't do investigations every day but addressing the   conversation of how to collect the data would be very beneficial.If students were encouraged to collect their own data-or to save time-research some of this data on the internet and have them decide on how one would choose the best truck  then go through the process of creating the linear regression  they would have more buy in.

This was exactly my thought when I analyzed the Car Weight and Milage Activity  how could we improve this?  I thought the most important aspect of this activity was that students would be able to predict behavior based on a given data set and some calculation. But you're right  this activity does not allow for students to follow the entire investigation cycle. In this activity  I think it would be force of habit to strictly go into the analyze phase  and skip over posing a question. Students here would have a hard time trying to understand the context of this information.  I love your suggestion- students going out and collecting their own data. This would allow students to understand what the values meant and how to interpret them. Additionally  I think they would be more engaged.  I have another suggestion. Before giving these students the questions  a b c and d  I think it would be beneficial to give some guiding questions such as:  -What question are we trying to answer?  -How could this data be collected?  -What would be an appropriate sample size?  -What graphical representations could be used to better visualize and understand this data?  Overall  I liked the predictability aspect of this activity. It could also raise the question of trust. To what extent is this data right? Can I trust it? I think this activity would be great  with a little more focus to other areas other than just the regression line.      Stephanie

The  learning goals and expectations are clear  thus  because this is real life  data  additional activities can be conducted related to the same topic.       <span style=\font-size:11.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot; sans-serif\"">   <!--[if !supportLineBreakNewLine]-->   <!--[endif]--></span><span style=\""orphans: auto;widows: 1;-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;  float:none;word-spacing:0px\"">      </span>  """

Also  this data appears to come from a real source and can be tied in with environmental discussions.  When ever I teach a data task  I like the context to be highly engaging for the students.  This task encourages student discussion about the data and what causes the variation in the data.  Further  the opportunity for students to share and compare helps the students to form meaningful conclusions from the data.

The data set is large. Many questions could be asked/answered if students could easily switch between their data subset and the full set as well as switch easily between different types of displays. In my experience  if students choose a display that might not work so well for a particular data set  they are reluctant to attempt a different type of display (frustration  extra work  lack of understanding...). If students could switch between data displays easily  they may be more willing to make mistakes and learn from them.

I also felt that only one of the tasks made clear the \why would this be useful to know\"" behind the research question - the Old Faithful one says that people want to know how long it will be until it erupts again. It was also the only one that allows students to decide which graphical display(s) to use. I like the connection to geography with this activity. If I were using it  I probably would not give students the paper with all of the rows of data  I would simplify it by just giving each group a different set of two rows.  I think that the other two activities might have potential if they could address the question of \""why would this be useful to know\"".

Now granted  a teacher could motivate them once the activities started  but if there was some student-centered data  even if it was not their class  I think you could find more engaged students.    The other side  though  is students and eventually adults  will not always receive personalized data they need to sift through.  So I guess there is something to be said for using 'stale' data.

In particular  the struggles of collecting valid and reliable measures.  Depending on how large the class is  it can be hard to be certain that the many pour-ers are accurately putting the right brand soda into the right cups as well as preventing peeking by the tasters; alternatively  a small class will come up with a small data set.  Discussion of those possibilities (and how to control for them) would be great exposure to study design as long as the experience doesn't consume an entire class period or the sugar/caffeine doesn't disengage student attention to the topic.   I was more interested in the Television Time data because that data could be collected in far less class time through technology shared by multiple classrooms (Google Docs comes to mind).  The data sets contained the actual data and allowed for exploration of variability  comparison of different ways to graph the same data  disaggregating the data  mean vs. median  and several others.  Maybe I'm only valuing the variety of available analysis tools rather than a direct opportunity to <i>physically</i> collect data.  I still think there's data collection concerns that can be addressed even with this activity:  units of reporting  discrete vs. continuous  response bias  etc.

The Television Time activity is intriguing and I think could even be expanded by not only looking at each class but the gender of the student.  A question that comes to my mind is how much homework does each teacher assign.  Does that affect the amount of time spent watching TV?

Why not introduce with:  You may have seen the competition in tv commercials between Coke and Pepsi. Each company claims their product tastes best.  What does it mean for a cola product to \""taste great\"" and how can we represent that/quantify that/test that?  i.e. have students first create a criteria.  Beginning with this discussion might also bring out some bias. It is important for students to take ownership by establishing what it is that they will collect data on and how it might be represented and analyzed.

In Car weight and MPG and in Coke vs. Pepsi    the students are told exactly what to do in each step.  The television   task  on the other hand  gives the data in a form that is not conducive   to comparison and asks the students to compare the distributions.  To do   this effectively  they need to decompose the dotplot into two dotplots   or back-to-back dotplots.  And although Mr Jebson's students have both a   higher mean and median of hours watching TV  Ms Lee's students have   greater variability in their hours of watching TV.  The shapes of the   distributions are also different:  the distribution Ms Lee's class   appears to be skewed right while Mr Jebson's class appears to be   reasonably symmetric.  None of this is obvious with the data displayed   as given.   I do agree that the Coke vs. Pepsi task has the most   potential for the entire investigative cycle  but it needs to be   written in a way that the students design the experiment  analyze the   results  and form their conclusions.  Even then  the question has been posed for them.

Gapminder does provide data here: <a href=\http://www.gapminder.org/data/\"" target=\""_blank\"">http://www.gapminder.org/data/ </a>  The data are real data from sources like the UN or World Bank  and not simulated data.

I had seen the tool before  but after exploring it a bit more again for this course  I decided to share it right away with the Social Studies folks I support.  (I'm a technology integration coach.)  Lots of ideas for sparking kids' interest in historical events by having them interact with real data were coming to mind for me.   I was looking  for example  at the infant mortality rate data and \trailing\"" for the US data on that point.  The spike in 1918 caught my eye.  Then I recalled from my own history lessons that there was an influenza epidemic then.  However  many HS students would not have that background. So my idea was to start a lesson about that time period by showing students this particular data set and allowing them to \""discover\"" that spike on their own and see what questions it might generate.  Then give them some time to explore to see if they could find out why it might have been.  The following days would be the instruction/reading/lecture etc about that time period in general.  Hopefully that interaction with data analysis would build some interest that might not have otherwise been there. """

The main difficulties as I would see it with political polling are (i) the difficulties of getting a representative sample of people who will actually vote come the polling day; (ii) people not giving accurate information to polling questions  possibly due to concerns regarding lack of confidentiality of their information; and (iii) last minute mind changing in the voting booth. Plus there is also the argument that voting behaviour may be swayed by poll results  for example being encouraged to vote for a more popular party or voting tactically  i.e. voting for a party that is not their first preference in order to prevent a less desired party from winning.

Just like the basic understanding about addition and multiplication  at least the concepts as sample  sampling  generalization  representativeness  etc. should be taught more publicly (media? good idea  but we know how media runs!). Just then  we would be able to explain how a poll including only 500 participants could really reflect the actual outcomes from a general election.

Yes  it may take some time to set up a data collection activity or experiment  but I think that students gain so much more when they actually collect data themselves  versus being handed a piece of paper with a list of numbers or a table (whether the data is \real world\"" or not). One of the biggest benefits is that students enjoy it! They can also learn about how to work with others and the importance of controlling for other variables.

I agree that students should collect their own data  and like your reasons as a reminder. However  I haven't had my students collect meaningful data very often (mostly flipping coins  rolling dice  etc  which I don't think of as meaningful). However  when I've collected data  there are always some issues such as answers that don't make sense  or numbers mis-recorded.

I think data generation by students helps them interpret results.  For example  I have students flick dimes and then quarters and then graph with parallel box-and-whisker plots.  Their personal experiences about the coins and how hard/easy they were to flick and how far they went help them to interpret the class results and their own data in relation to the class.

It is promoted and talked about around New Zealand and we use the data from it all year long in class.  http://new.censusatschool.org.nz  It is really useful because it is a really large dataset and (mostly) representative of NZ schools. Then we can also talk about how it is only those who chose to participate. Who do we not think would be represented? Do we think it is still representative of NZ schools? Is it a big enough sample? IS it a census?  I love it!     I also have other datasets that I use in class with similar contexts like populations of kiwi birds. I put all the laminated cards into little baggies and have students select the cards out of the population randomly so they understand what taking a sample looks like. Are our samples different? Why do they have different sample statistics if they are from the same populations? Are they close? How different do you think they would be? Then we go from there!

Great idea with the balloons.  With my year 9 class I always pose the quesiton 'Who writes bigger  Adults or Year 9?'  We then discuss what I mean by bigger  and we end up by defining bigger by length as it's easy to measure. We use a sentence that has all the letters of the alphabet (The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog) and measure the length from the first pen stroke to the furthest pen stoke. We then collect the data in a tally chart (continuous data)  draw a histogram and calculate the average(s)   Homework is then set to get two adults to do the same thing. Next lesson we do the same analysis and compare the results.  You normally get an interesting set of responses and some pretty obvious bias if all the students bring 2 bits of data in.  Great to get the students thinking and applying some statistical skills.

Based on the level at which I teach  I can easily avoid questions that might be of concern ethically. I do however find that many student-generated data sets illustrate very common aspects of data distributions - a clearly defined median  a distinct outlier  etc...

Just yesterday  my students were provided with a data display regarding shoe size. It was from a textbook.

There were some questions that I had an educated guess at but according to my score there must be a few misconceptions I have that I don't even know about. I am looking forward to immersing myself more fully into the world of stats teaching during this course and hopefully correcting some of my misconceptions along the way!

Assessments are a tool that a teacher uses to gauge the level of learning that their students have obtained. Assessments can take the many different forms. The most traditional is the kind that we participated in. This is good to keep in mind so that as we go through the units we can help prepare the students so they can feel confident in taking a traditional assessment. Keeping up with the knowledge the students have obtained and challenging their understanding so they can grow.

When you register you are assigned to a group to make the forums a little smaller to get to know people since there are over 700 people registered for the course. So there is a mix of all kinds of jobs in each group. Feel free to read other groups as well. Sometimes they are having conversations your group is not or suggesting a new resource. However the design team will share links that other participants suggests or point participants to other groups if there is a conversation we don't want you to miss.

I'm a little worried this isn't more common knowledge--perhaps it's a situation that Gapminder wasn't on our radar when that happened  and hopefully it was more of a story then. I hope Google continues to stay on the cutting edge of data visualisation  and furthermore  I hope when new developments arise we hear about it given their prominent position.   That said  little innovation has happened in the data vis space over the past few decades--at least to the magnitude of Gapminder.

The video on Gapminder shows that students can learn to analyze data over the course of many years. I even played around with Gapminder to try and deduce information as those students did in the video.     I also enjoyed watching the video. The teacher took student interest in researching the popularity of a name and brought it to the classroom. This allowed students to research something in a way they were comfortable doing. I actually loved that one student used Wolfram Alpha to research the name. I did that for my name as well (Michelle) and noticed that my name was very popular in the 1970s. It's important to see that trends of names increase and decrease over time.

Each of the students came up with a different way of sampling  but each of them produced some sort of bias. It would be a great opportunity to discuss the most productive ways of sampling and to explain that the effectiveness of a sampling method varies between experiments.   I think the question also provides an opportunity to discuss good questions that can be answered by statistical investigation. I don't think that there is a great way to actually discover what the average age of people named Jane is. After discussing different sampling methods it would become apparent that such a question may not have  a very reliable statistical answer.

I would then discuss with the class the merits/pitfalls of each method in determining Jane's likely age.  Students may not even see the bias/bad design in their own methods until they have others to compare to.  This activity lends itself well to discussion of sampling.  We can't find every single person in the world named Jane and find out her age  so how do you get around that?  This would lead to a broader discussion of other statistical claims based on sampling.  (e.g. - \4 out of 5 dentists choose Trident gum for their patients who chew gum.\""  How might the sampling method throw off your results? """

But one of the struggles I have with my high-achieving AP stats students is that they really want to know the 'way' to do something.  Stats is a course that makes them feel very uncomfortable because there isn't always a cut and dry method or answer.  I liked the Jane's age activity because it showed how students used their wealth of 'non academic' knowledge to work on an academic problem.  I really think my students would struggle with coming up with their own tools to find a solution  but if I showed them the video afterwards  they might see how to use all their available tools to problem solve.        I also liked the quick article.  The more I teach stats the more I feel like it is 'the most important math class'.  But I also feel like it is the most neglected in other courses - it's the thing that's cut when there's not a lot of time.  More and more  I\m the 'Statistics for all' advocate.       """

It generated some interesting discussion about the validity/fitness-for-purpose of different sampling methods. It also reinforced our belief that statistics training for adults needs to be based on problems that learners actually face in their day-to-day work. We often experience resistance to this when helping subject matter experts to design courses  so it is nice to see that learning experts share our view:)      I have also seen the tool used to create this clip by students to create evidence that they understand various concepts and I like it as an assessment method

As a Master's student in statistics  my experience is that R and SAS are the most prevalent. Python seems to be up and coming  as well.   I wanted to add that SAS has a free edition aimed at teachers and students: <span style=\line-height: 1.42857;\""><a href=\""http://www.sas.com/en_us/software/university-edition.html\"">http://www.sas.com/en_us/software/university-edition.html</a></span>  The free edition is not as powerful as the full version  but is a good platform for learning SAS.  After coding in R for a couple years  I find R fairly intuitive. However  one of my professors mentioned that there is limited success with introducing R into introductory statistics courses. My experience is that R requires some knowledge of coding in order to fully use its capabilities. For those with experience in R  what do you think about using R in the classroom?  SAS still seems to be the industry standard for statisticians. Some of the high schools in the Raleigh/Cary area offer SAS courses  which is a great opportunity for students to learn SAS early. For those who go into data science  SAS is one of the vital tools to know.  What do you all think about the use of software in statistics?  At my university  I see a trend towards computing and using software to interpret data. With the large datasets available today  statistical software are becoming more and more important. I've seen a lot of data scientist job postings that require applicants to know one or more computing languages.  Something else to consider: JMP  SAS  R  Python  etc. are commonly used in industry  but there is another set of software targeted towards learners of statistics: Tinkerplots  Fathom  and Statcrunch are three examples. How do you think teachers can integrate one or both types of software into the classroom? Do you think introducing students to industry-level software is important? """

Partly because high school teachers and community college instructors have no support for learning a new skill.  There's also legitimate concern about the cognitive load required to learn both statistical concepts and software operation  particularly when it requires programming.  Finally  the vast majority of intro stats students are fulfilling a gen ed requirement.  Those who are in majors that will actually <i>do</i> statistics will learn to do that in a discipline-specific course that probably uses a package that is prevalent in the discipline practice or research.

The reason I prefer to teach using Excel is that it does everything an introductory statistics course requires  without the students having to learn a new software.  We have to keep in mind that the vast majority of our students are not going to be statisticians  so giving them tools that they can continually expand on is more productive  in my opinion.  In graduate level statistics class  then yes  introduce the statistical software packages -- but they are not needed in intro stats.

Perhaps students don't need to fully use its capabilities. It is easy to dump data in from outside sources. Many calculations and tests can be run with simple commands. In addition  R Studio makes it more accessible than the command line interface.  I would like to try using it with students. A small list of commands allows students the opportunity to focus more on design and interpretation than formulas and calculation. Also  an occasional student might pursue an interest in R  a marketable skill.

Wow!  I think we need to realize that statistics is not in itself math - yet  our students must have a firm foundation of mathematical terms and skills.  We must teach our students not to fear the world of statistics  but rather to embrace it.  Believe me  I am still working on reaching that level ... which is why I am taking yet another course in this area.  I'm the one to go to for Reading skills and strategies  definitely not statistics.  So  here I am.

My background in is physics  specifically modeling physics. The approach we take with students is to investigate real world phenomena and discover the formulas from there.

No one can memorize every formula  but if you can reason out how to get to the formula problem solving is more intuitive and makes more sense.

Being a pure mathematician  I feel like in any field we should embrace the meaning of what we are doing instead of merely robotically following procedures. If humankind is to make improvements in knowledge  there are going to have to be people who deeply understand concepts and meaning not merely how to make calculations. I am sad that even math classes do not focus on the meaning that they could. It is even more tragic when a statistics class (that is inseparably connected to applications) becomes a list of procedures out of context.  It is hard to do  but we can work together to make the teaching of statistics more applied.

I played with it for a long time just looking at different variables and isolating certain countries.  I could see how Gapminder might even be used in my calculus classes. For example  you could do an exponential or polynomial regression of some variable over time (e.g. - CO2 emissions in the US) and make predictions for future years using both the regression equation AND tangent line approximations (if current rates of change remained constant).  Students could explain the differences between their predictions and also explore whatever other variables interested them.

Beyond the meaning  we can link these to students' world: mean is what we often used for grades on report cards; mode is an example of the score that most students get in a test; median - link to a suburb area family's average income level  etc.      I think this can build a platform for students to do interpretation/analysis in middle&amp;high school level.

We have much higher enrollment in our stats classes than in calculus.  There are a lot of programs that either require a statistics course or have a math requirement that allows students to choose between statistics and college algebra.  This is particularly true of the nursing program (I have a disproportionately high proportion of nursing students in my stats classes).  For most of my students  the intro stats course is the last math course they take.  I agree that for most students  familiarity with statistics will be more relevant to their major and their daily lives than calculus.  While there are certainly exceptions to this (engineers and science majors obviously will need calculus)  students in all majors will benefit from at least an introductory statistics course.

I would then have them find an example of a paper in which they would typically use in their field.  Usually  this paper had statistical data that needed to be scrutinized for the student to use the information in their data.  If they were undeclared major  I would show them a newspaper.  I tried to pull things from the student's life to show that student why they needed to understand statistics and how vital it was to their life.

We can help them along the way  and once everything is as good as it can be  we give it a stamp of approval with a logo that they can use in their presentation.

I am really glad you here!  You will hear in some of our Expert Panel videos how we discuss the importance of developing foundational understandings of data and chance in our early learners! When I was a doctoral student in Mathematics Education in 1997  I had to do an internship in elementary classroom. I was paired with a phenomenal teacher in a 1st grade classroom (my teaching experience was all middle and high school). She challenged me to create a unit for introducing probability to young kids. It was THIS very experience that made me switch my research focus to children's early learning of probability and then eventually led to my career focus on K-12 statistics education.  So what you do with your kids really matters! And  they are SOOOOOO much fun! :-)  (my daughter is in 4th grade and son in 1st grade  so I get the FUN first hand!)  I suggest a few things to get you started.

These are just my thoughts from my grade-school experience in the last 10 years.  It just isn't enough to do it in the classroom.  There must be purpose in it and that purpose must be clear and interesting to the students.

I think statistics is a good place to show the purpose of math  though  because so much data is clearly connected to real-life experiences.

For example  one year our district was considering a 4 day school week and another year they considered a trimester schedule.  Great topics  great interest  and the students even presented their findings to the school board.  Of course we don't always have such controversial  interesting topics  but the students can usually find something.  I also give bonus points if their research is done for an outside audience (client?).

Supplies: desks  ruler  paper cups  string  pennies  raw spaghetti noodles.  Procedure: pair students and supply them.  Have students poke holes in cups and thread string to create loop. Have students start with one spaghetti noodle and desks 5 cm apart.  Load pennies until the noodle breaks and record data.  Add a noodle and repeat until five noodles.  Move desk to 10 cm and repeat.  Repeat until noodle no longer reach.  Analyze data.

I ask the students to think of one question that needs a number for an answer.  For example  how many pets does your family own  how many shoes do you own  how old are you  etc.  Before I get the students to represent the data in several different graphical representations  I ask the students to go around and ask each person their question  at the same time.  It is just something fun I like to do to get the students a feel for the collection step  while also having data collected from them.  I also feel that from websites to surveys to questionnaires  we can feel inundated with data collection  and I feel this experiment gives a small feel for it.

Now that there are so many data sets available  I'd like to discuss examples with others. Some ideas of real world problems could be: How is being a refuge related to the types of governments in your country of origin? How is poverty related to types of government (or geographic features)? How is incarceration related to ethnicity? to SES? to family type? How does SES affect the way students use technology? If anyone has examples of statistics projects such as these that they have used in their classrooms  I'd love to see them.

As I previously divulged  I haven't had much chance to work with Statistics. Now  reading through this thread  it is giving me a good idea of what a Statistics class could possibly look like. It is giving me a lot of ideas on how to start  and/or maintain the interest on the class.

I think this is important because if you capture the student's attention with the subject area  then their interest in the process of the statistical analysis may be increased.   As a person who has zero (95% CI = 0.0  0.0) interest in sports  that wouldn't capture my attention but your spaghetti example or an another example from science would capture my attention.  I suspect students would be the same way.  Given the importance of social media in their lives  a social media example might be quite appropriate.

The updated GAISE College Report will emphasize the need to acknowledge that this is not a bivariate world!  For a long time  I have students question the contexts in which I teach scatter plots  correlation coefficients  and simple linear regression because they know that other factors play into the relationships.  Much of the actual design for collection and computation using multivariate data are topics for a second course in statistics but it is useful to introduce some in the first course.  It makes us more believable to admit that simple linear regression is not a likely tool for a real researcher to use.  Perhaps  we can even entice a few students into that next course.  :-)

I think that by having these meaningful discussions about the real world implications of statistics is what makes it real for them. Using real data sets and showing them how it relates to the world around them is not only meaningful  but is what statistics truly is.  Use contexts that are real for your students. I had a class last year that was made up mostly of students who played sport. I used lots of sports datasets which are easily accessible and full of stats. This year I had a lot of students passionate about government and politics so I used a lot of governmental datasets. Making it interesting for your students is important. I even have given them a choice of topic for assessment in the past so that they felt like what they were researching had a purpose.

Every year our writing scores are so low. Not sure if this is a national trend or not but it has become a major focus for us. I try to incorporate writing into the course everywhere I can. At the beginning of the year  they write as much as they can about how statistics is used in their daily life and where they encounter stats. Usually I get a paragraph about sports and the lottery. Throughout the year we do many classroom experiments and real world discussions. At the end of the year we revisit that paper and every year the students amaze me by going from that one paragraph to a 3-5 page paper about how they encounter statistics in their lives.   I am loving everyone's ideas they are posting about their activities and classroom experiments!

Then you look at the improvement in the estimation from the first guess to the second one. The idea is that feedback improves learning.

I guess the main idea behind this unit is to get us thinking about the quality of the task and how we can apply aspects of the theory by using the activity.

This year I made a modification on-the-run in a class where instead of measuring two body parts  students guessed their heights and them measured them. I guess this turned the activity away from a simple linear regression one into a calibration one  and with a bit more thought I could exploit the difference more clearly in the class.

The most interesting point I got form the lesson was that one of the big differences between the two are variability  and uncertainty of conclusions.  In general  not every single time  but in math results are found through deductive reasoning  typically with one correct answer or set of answers.  In statistics however  conclusions are found through inductive reasoning  confidence intervals are used to describe a certain outcome.     Part of this difference comes from the variability inherent in real life  the variability inherent in data.  And I really just found this interesting.  Another quick way to say another one of the differences is to say that Math quantifies data while Statistics interprets and makes conclusions from data.  I really thought that thought alone could change the way I teach my stat classes  and my math classes for that matter.  Some questions I'll pose to anyone who wants to explore this a bit more  what are some other differences found in this week's lesson  what are some differences not touched on?  What similarities are there?  Last question  mathematical algorithms and theories are applied to find statistical answers  but could anyone think of a case when the converse is true  a time that statistical analysis led to a mathematical solution / break through or revelation.     Have a great week everyone.

In these courses we emphasized that there are different ways presenting concepts - graphically  numerically  algebraically. But we always emphasize in Mathematics that regardless of however manner we approached and presented and attacked the problem  in whichever way we solved it  we'd always arrive to the same answer  because there is one and only one answer or solution to any problem.  I teach Statistics sparingly  in fact for the last 2 or 3 weeks of the school year after we finish with the  AP Calculus test. I teach it to our seniors just so they would have an idea of how real Statistics work - real  compared to some Statistics  as we liberally call it in the lower grades. Here in Statistics we teach them though that the answer depends on the question it asks for. Hence  a data is interpreted so many different ways  depending on the question and context. This to me is the most basic and yet the most important difference between Mathematics and Statistics. Because of this  the approach and mind-set in approaching the problem broadens in Statistics.

That being said  I feel like a lot of time needs to be spent on each part individually and then put all of them together during different parts of the school year.  In no way am I saying that we shouldn't strive to use the cycle frequently  but if our goal for the unit is to talk about how to conduct a study or experiment  then I will focus on the second phase.  If our goal is to learn how to do inference  I'll have to focus on the third and fourth phase.  Maybe I'll try to integrate 1 of these  complete cycles each unit in my AP stats course.  Btw - the car weight and mileage task looks very much like a problem students might see on an AP exam.

All through my middle and high school experience  statistics is taught as one of the topics of mathematics and we just learned how to turn data into graphs  and how to calculate the mean  median  standard deviation etc. So  it was basically only about calculations and procedures. However  the discussion of the difference between mathematics and statistics made me once again appreciate the importance of sense making. The process of developing habits of mind is neither easy nor effortless  but by emphasizing on why/when/how something works lead educational outcomes to be much more fruitful than ever.

I was lucky to be teaching high school mathematics in NZ shortly after this approach to teaching statistics was embedded into the curriculum  and I was amazed at how students of all abilities could collect  organise  display and analyse data when they were offered a context they understood and had interest in. Shortly afterwards  I returned to teaching in the UK and received some criticism for the time my (able) students took to complete the statistics unit because we found out own data and used its context to learn the skills of organising  displaying  analysing and making decisions and produced a piece of work that used skills from all parts of the Statistical Enquiry Cycle. But the students had such a great time producing really high quality work and did extremely well in their end-of-course assessment.  I have also watched my own children as pre-schoolers classifying and grouping objects (and even making \""Bar graphs\"" of beads or lollies or Lego by lining them up according to colour) and it seems even more obvious that this is the approach we should be using to develop statistical skills.

The sad thing is that the point at which they come to a statistician for advice is usually after they have designed their experiments  gathered the data  and now wish to analyse the data  which is too late to point out flaws in the study design and data collection method. Statistical advice is then often simply trying to retrieve the situation as best we can  when we could do so much more if we were approached at an earlier stage.

Statistics is more of the why trends in data happen and this takes some more thinking than a regular algebra problem  for example. As a math major and future math teacher  it's important to create your own distinction of what the difference between both is. Its vital to understand both as we continue our education in both branches and to teach our children and students this as well.

As a math major  I have to admit that I always liked algebra  geometry  trig  and calculus a lot more than I liked statistics.  I took two stats courses in college as part of the requirements for my major and always felt like my understanding of stats was kind of fuzzy.  I guess I am a \black and white\"" kind of person  and the ambiguity and variability in statistics pushed me out of my comfort zone.  I really liked the quote that math is statistics with a standard deviation of zero  and I think that's why I gravitated towards the math rather than the statistics.  Knowing these definitions of math and statistics helps me better understand the discomfort I had with statistics.  At the same time  I can understand the importance of statistical reasoning  and hope I can better communicate this to my students  rather than just focusing on the algorithms for the calculations and the pat answers of textbook questions.  I am thankful for this course and the perspectives I am gaining! """

I just heard a Nobel laureate in chemistry say that he believed chemistry was similar to art. That being said  I would also propose that math is a science of a different variety. There are many conjectures in math waiting to be proven. Just last year  Project Flyspeck completed a formal proof of the Kepler Conjecture. There are outer limits to the field which are yet to be learned/discovered.   The way we teach science to children is generally not scientific. We teach them what was already discovered through science or set them up to draw a predetermined conclusion. It is important to have background information in a field of study  if someone hopes to extend that field. The math that is taught to the majority of our population  including most scientists and undergraduate math majors  is foundational. That does not mean the entire field is static.    I think what sets math apart from the other disciplines is that everything must be proven using watertight logic and procedures. When a conclusion is finally reached  it is arrived at with certainty. In the traditional sciences (I'll include stats in that group) conclusions must be drawn under conditions of uncertainty. The best we can do is to accurately assess the likelihood of our conclusions and report them in a responsible way. This is why I think it is important to teach statistics. Too many uncertain conclusions are presented and taken as certainty. Math is useful and beautiful  but our world does not often present real life certainty.

When working with statistics we have to observed our environment and pose questions that intrigue us.  Then  we have to develop a method to collect  organize  analyze and interpret data to make draw our conclusions.  This procedure is parallel to the scientific method.  On the other hand  Statistics is also considered an art since investigators need to carefully handle the data to be able to achieve a given objective and carefully make inferences using the collected data.

It does involve mathematical concepts  and it is quite technical  but there are also important decisions left to the statistician. We are able to work with data in multiple ways and draw conclusions that may be defended  but also disputed on other grounds. It makes for lively work!

Statistics is really an application of investigative science.   Who is to say which came first art  history or science.  I think the very first people that started to record information were in fact participating in all three disciplines.  But when they took inferences or made some learning from those first recorded information pieces it was in fact science.  Sometimes we focus so much on one discipline but fail to see the inter-relatedness.   I would hope to see more merging of science and math standards (disciplines) in the future.

They were asked to determine how many shoes were larger than size 9. Over half the class said \""zero\"" because none of the individual shoe sizes has more than 9 responses.    Without addressing the misconception  I quickly surveyed the class about their actual shoe size  drew a similar plot  and asked the same question  but used size 6 instead of 9 based on the shoe sizes of the kids in the class.    Only one student was not able to answer the exact question using the class data.    Of course  we took the time to break the question down  what do each of the x's mean on the plot  what do the numbers mean on the line  .... but I found it interesting that they were able to understand the exact same concept when they generated the data versus having the data given to them.   Having students pose their own questions about the data is a wonderful suggestion. Thank you!  """

Good question- and here is my attempt to give you my opinion.  When teaching statistics  should every posed question include collecting data ourselves? Definitely not. There is not enough time to do that  even though we can see the benefits such experiences have on our students. However  there needs to be a happy medium  because without collecting data themselves  students will not understand how to collect data  the importance of the study design  and the context of the data.  Of course  there would be steps to building this understanding  from middle school to college. Without understanding the posing question and the investigation part  statistics is taught like every other mathematics course and understanding is lacking.  Honestly  that is why I am taking this course. My entire educational career  statistics has been taught to me as computation. You look at the data- compute the information asked. However  that is not true understanding. So often teachers turn to a simple algorithm to explain  for example  how to divide fractions. But if we are able to break it down and teach understanding  retention is often to follow. Here  the analysis step is the \algorithm\"". If we skip to this step  will students be able to connect real world ideas to statistics? Probably not.     Stephanie """

Taking data at face value almost always leads to false conclusions  or - even worse - explanations of causality. But the doesn't mean we should automatically distrust or mistrust data or graphs.  I commented in an earlier thread that rarely in science is statistical significance given the weight it should be.  Many decisions are made that could very well affect our lives - by government  doctors  engineers  statisticians - that are based off of data or visualizations from data that are not originally statistically significant.  How can we build in a natural questioning skepticism into the interpretation of data without promoting distrust in statistics?

If you think about it  our research projects and our academic papers spent the majority of the reports validating the data  the assumptions  the experimental design...all the areas we as sceptics should explore. But this interrogation takes vigilant energy  and it's repetitive...and boring.  The world is changing rapidly  and our communication is being downsized to bite-sized tid-bits  which doesn't have time or space for such supportive content. Even if someone takes the time to go through the motions to preface their work with the appropriate content  most people will not read it--straight to the conclusion! To be fair  even my university professors started with the conclusion.   How about economics? (I've a MS in Applied Economics.) All economic discussions completely hinge on assumptions (not to mention statistical assumptions) and never are these assumptions covered under the headlines.   This practice is how the real world works. As a statistician  I hardly do statistics  and usually spend most of my day in sceptical discussions challenging the design and underlying assumptions.   So  to your point  how do we foster scepticism? I'm not sure this is going to be anything short of almost impossible. I find this similar to another noble question  \How do we teach people to care?\"" I don't think people will care about statistical quality until there is a penalty for misuse of statistics. Statistics has a bad wrap  we all know the quote  \""There are three kinds of lies: lies  damned lies  and statistics.\"" -British Prime Minister <a title=\""Benjamin Disraeli\"" href=\""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Disraeli\"">Benjamin Disraeli</a>. But  what's the penalty of carelessly reporting wrong statistics (vindictively or not)? There isn't even a penalty for practicing statistics without qualifications. So  why would anyone care more than they have the resource to?  Frankly  I believe the answer is that we don't have time for it  unless its literally our job. Besides this  I'm told we need to find a way to make it less boring--some popular suggestions these days are to gamify business processes so millennials will actively engage. Perhaps we can foster scepticism by awarding points to each sceptical enquiry that was fruitful  with high scores and tournament champions. Or we should produce many many more statisticians and pay them to continue asking questions for the good of humanity (but at a social cost as no one will ever want to hear the answer to the question \""So  what do you do?\"")  """

This year I've taught two lessons to my students that relied around popular media and digging into the statistical ideas behind it by questioning my students' thoughts in reaction to the media compared to the raw statistics behind the pieces. Our first such exploration was into the well-known Prudential insurance commercial about how people are living longer so we need to save more for retirement. After introducing histograms and how to read them  we looked at the histogram in the commercial and evaluated the claims made about it. I then pushed my students to generate a list of questions about the assumptions behind the commercial  and they did a great job on their own recognizing that \the oldest person you know\"" is not a great measure of life expectancy and that the sampling methods were shady. A few weeks later when the WHO report about processed meats being carcinogenic was released and my senior boys were worried about giving up bacon  I found the original report and read it with them  working through the statistics given by the WHO.

For example  today we did the spaghetti activity and to walk around and listen to the students predicting and discussing the why questions was great.  If I had simply written a program to simulate that task  then would they have asked those same questions.  Yes  I would have an additional hour to explain multiple regression  but what gets lost by removing the hands-on aspect?

First  students who get to witness a string of six ones in a row gain a different understanding of random variability than someone who's simulation looks weird once  or even six times. I have heard students tell stories like  \Remember that time you couldn't stop rolling ones?\"". Second  time to think and communicate at intermittent stages in the process allows students to arrive at new realizations as the activity unfolds. However  expediency has it's own value  and sample size is much easier to demonstrate with simulations. In other words  they both have their time and place.  """

Could the class split into groups where one-half works on a tactile exploration of the learning objective and the other half uses technological simulations? They could share their results and each group would experience some of the benefits of each?   Or perhaps students could collect the experimental data once and reuse the collected data for multiple lessons.  Student to student discourse would be limited  but students could conduct the tactile experiments on their own time. A discussion of the process could then take place in class before a whole-class activity involving a simulation. The methods and their effectiveness in achieving the learning objective could be compared and critiqued.

The largest element that I am taking from this Unit is the  SASI Framework.  Being able to identify  individual students level of sophistication will help a great deal in my  classroom.  Before I knew the terminology  for these levels  I found myself having to do a quick refresh for many of the  topics  starting the students at A  spending a large amount of time asking level  B types of questions before finally pushing for the students to analyze and  interpret data at a level C.       Borrowing from Chris Franklin  I think that designing a task  specifically developed to teach a specific concept is an amazing idea.  This can be used in conjunction with taking  students from level to level  slowly growing their understanding as well as  asking more and more from them as you go.   The family size was a great example of this  seeing multiple and  different representations come into play  as well as different levels of  reasoning and types of questions being asked.       My question however  is how would one become better or  faster at identifying students level of stat sophistication?  Does it come with practice and time  does it  naturally become ingrained as one continues to teach and actively work at  it.  I would say that is what I naturally  do  with differentiation  scaffolding  etc without knowing the terminology  behind it  but I would still like other‚Äôs opinions.       My last question will be  how can we use this knowledge to  further help and grow our students  what are some more example tasks  or  different frames of mind we can adapt to help our students.        Thanks everyone and have a great week!

My biggest take away for this unit is the SASI model which focuses on the importance of what level my students are performing at.  To comment on your question  \How would one become better or faster at identifying students level of stat sophistication?\"" - I would do a pre-assessment activity or a formative assessment activity to see where they are at.

Where does the idea  mathematically  of <i>n</i> vs <i>n - 1 </i>come from?  It is easy to understand that people use standard deviation as a numerical summary where mean is appropriate  but the why of this is often much harder. """

It is a sad truth  as Chris Franklin pointed out  that many students can define the mean and tell you how to find it  BUT they really do not know the importance of the mean when looking at data.  We  as educators  must help our students at the elementary levels  so that when they reach college they are no longer at Level A or B.  I cannot lie.  There have been times in my adult life when dealing with statistics that I did not have the prior knowledge and skill sets needed  and I was forced to start at the bottom.

I have had kids lose the package and make their mom's stop at the store to get another  and on the coin toss exercise one student collected about 4 sets of data because he was bored and just kept going.

Playing with the data is using multiple methods to observe the data graphically and to analyze the data in order to gain insight into the phenomenon being tested.  Playing with the data IS NOT fabricating data because you work with the data that you have; you don't add data and you don't eliminate data.  In general  having an analysis plan before gathering data is best to avoid type I error and other bias in the analysis BUT often a researcher can gain insight into a phenomenon by playing with the data in a manner that is different from the original data analysis plan.   Trends and outcomes that might not  be readily observable or expected might emerge.  Importantly  when I observe something as a result of playing with the data  I always apply a higher stringency to subsequent tests of significance in order to make sure that I'm really seeing what I think I'm seeing.

When we actually use it for an activity they are excited to see what it can be used for  or the kids who are usually off task think that it is a tangent and realize too late that we are doing exactly what I had planned.  Because they play around with it so much  it does not take long to go over how to use the program.     I find that the one in the calculator is very easy for them to use because they know that calculator so well by this point in time.  However  I look forward to finding some new programs to use so that they can do some bigger trials.

They were always engaged in the material and because it came to life in front of them they seemed to work with it better than if I had just given them data. Of course there are going to be time constraints  but we trying to make the course useful and understandable  so giving a little extra time for actually collecting the data is well worth it.

In my statistics program  my professors and classmates tend to call that 'exploratory data analysis.' When you say there's a similarity between playing with the data and simulating data  are you referring to the methods that students use to look at either real data or simulated data?  With regard to the original question  I can only comment on my own experience. My first experience with simulating data involved tossing dice in high school. I didn't recognize the task as a simulation at the time  and I wasn't able to generalize the results beyond results for our class. I think that had we used statistical software  then I would've been able to generalize the results much more easily  since software allows us to run multiple simulations very quickly.  In my undergraduate studies  I struggled with the idea of simulating data according to some assumed model. The idea of fabricating data based on some arbitrary construct confused me for a couple semesters. However  I was coding my own simulations at the time  which I think is much less intuitive than using existing software. I struggled both with the coding and with the idea of simulating data.   Looking at the available software now  I feel like using software to visualize simulations makes the concept much more intuitive for high school students.

I want to give the students plenty of time to develop and get inot the reasarch/role of the activity.  It may require prep the day before with the students  a quck overview the day off  follow up the next class.  Like all class work one needs to determine if the time is worth the outcome.

I also think that simulations allow fulfilling learning outcomes for students in mixed ability Statistics classes because students can approach the problem with different levels of sophistication  and to choose the approach that is most appropriate to the task  even if they know there are more sophisticated approaches available.

However our data sets are much smaller since we are doing actual experimentation and taking measurements by hand.  My students are very good at the analysis of data since that has been a major focus of mine for the last 20 years.  Last year we started to incorporate the new NGSS standards which focus on Argumentative Driven Inquiry.  Our new focus is on students posing questions  designing experimentation to answer those questions  making claims  argumentation of those claims using evidence and justifying evidence.   With the smaller data sets it has been difficult to utilize some the stats computations like standard deviation  chi square...  I have started to accumulate data from past years however the methods of data collection sometimes differ from group to group and there is a much larger source of experimental error to discuss with the inherent equipment error.

Christine did a great job explaining variation as the minimum number of \""things\"" (e.g. - family members) to move so that every trial reaches the \""fair share\"" amount.  The line drawn on the block diagram at the mean level was a very effective visual.   """

Also  I have been grouping them in a very heterogeneous way where I group an A/B type student in Math with a C student and one D/F student. Hence  they are really very heterogeneous academically and oftentimes socially  emotionally  culturally and probably  also financially. It goes without saying that when they discuss a Math problem  each of these three types come towards a discussion from very different fronts. I also required them to always challenge each and every Math problem with questions of Why  Visualize it  Prove it  Present it Differently  and How come questions to each other.  And I've been amazed by how my students responded to this type of mental and academic stimulation. The discussions and presentations of solutions that are occurring from this arrangement ranges from the ludicrous and ridiculous to amazing and phenomenal.   I am just very happy that the SASI framework reflects in a way this arrangement and outcome. Further enhancing and reinforcing this classroom strategy and technique of academic cooperation with introducing them to and encouraging and imbibing them with the SASI framework  would greatly help them. And its true that developing this habit of frame of mind would go a long way for each student in deeper understanding and sophistication with basically everything  from the Math analysis to the Statistics posing of questions  collecting and analyzing data and the interpretation of results. The natural progression would evolved subtly and yet surely until this habits of the mind becomes second nature  even to the academically challenged among them.

I agree there can be pros and cons. For protection of my students in the various research projects  since I did not have permission to share video of their work with a larger audience  we chose to represent their work in this other format to give a \taste\"" of what real students did with various tasks. But animations can also allow us to show a condensed version of students work to just give a glimpse in a shortened amount of time  and we can choose what aspects to show in the animation.  However  it does not mean that other aspects of the original students' work session was not interesting...and many of you may have attended to other things the students did as interesting (or problematic).

I thought I might appropriate your idea regarding the Number of People Named Jane video.  I will offer several scenarios to choose from and have the students create a video or animation showing multiple applications and solutions that students in a class might reach for a given problem. In an effort to differentiate  students could also chose a scenario and show the right/wrong of a single statistical application (such an animated student making an error and an animated friend helping them by teaching them how to correct it).   This would be my end of semester project  so students would have to apply multiple strategies we have learned over the semester to show growth in understanding which is a target of the benchmarks.   I thought to use the level A B C from the SASI framework as the targets (presented in the rubric) for the level of work.  I am not quite sure how to do this.  Do you recommend showing the SASI framework to the students as a model for the whole class. Or is this something that should be imbedded in our instruction/expectations.   I thought I might introduce this now in class as I am shifting the task-driven portion of my semester.  (I have focused the first third of the semester on creating and analyzing graphs for categorical and quantitative data. Now we will be focused on refining those techniques through tasks and then adding a new  more sophisticated tactics each week or so.   I am teaching an introductory level class so  am focused on getting students to have solid (stellar!) skills with standard deviation.)  Do you have any recommendations?  I am not sure if I am being too ambitious.  I have found much success over the past few years just jumping in and trying stuff.  But I want to be sure the students don't pay the price for a project gone awry due to poor planning on my part.  I want to anticipate any major challenges.  Mary Ellen

It does not run statistical tests  show the least squares line  or a residual plot. It was designed to be more for middle grades but it is used frequently in introductory statistics courses in college because of the ability to run simulations. If I am just having students explore data  compare groups informally  or run simulations I use TinkerPlots. But if you want to move into more formal tests or adding a least squares line to a scatterplot I use Fathom. So it really depends what your goal is with the students.

For example  if we were investigating real dice from a company  we would have to actually roll the dice.  This means that getting 1000 rolls is pretty impractical and we might actually only get 100 rolls -- like the AP students.  Given those 100 rolls  we might have to decide.  The possible decisions are 1) buy the dice and use for Schoolopoly or 2) don't buy the dice.  We are not allowed the option of \there is not enough evidence to not buy the dice.\""  I have a set of data that I use that involves water quality at a particular well.

Building on your comment  another common limitation to data collection is cost. In many of my statistics courses  we've discussed the cost of collecting each observation. For example  collecting data on a sample of Antarctic ice could be much more expensive than asking people to fill out a survey. I'm taking a class on using statistics in forensic science  and my professor mentioned several instances in which the researchers ran out of funding to analyze all data.   Are there any ways you can think of to make students more aware of the challenges of collecting large amounts of data? For example  one of my classes built cost into the statistical model and emphasized the importance of selecting the best model for predicting results while simultaneously minimizing cost.   Collecting data 6 months apart for the well is a novel way to minimize time dependence. Have you also considered collecting data over shorter intervals of time  and building the time dependence into your model? I think that would be an interesting way to introduce students to data collected over time  if you're ever teaching students about time series.

I teach AP Stats. I could show my students how they can simulate 1000 trials rolling a dice but in the end  when they have to face the AP Stats exam  they are not allowed to use statistical software or computer. Now  rolling a dice 1000 times would not be practical and that would make your lesson a bit boring. I do 100 and then I have my students compare the experimental probability with the theoretical probability and talk about the Law of Large Numbers. They \get the picture\"" in the end and for me this is a very important time to express that we need to know how to be \""practical\"" and how to wisely use our \""time and money\"" when collecting data.

Also  maybe no one thought of it  but unless we can confirm it in looking at the computer code  a software program could have bias as well.  You use a programming language and a set of formulas  and a programming not fluent in statistics may accidentally add bias into the application.  Not sure that would happen often  if at all  but a further possibility.

I think it is important to have these discussions with students so that they understand that even though more data is in most cases better it is often impractical in many situations to actually collect.

I used to conduct burn testing on fiber optic cables used inside buildings. These were of course destructive tests as we measured flame and smoke propagation  and the cables were quite expensive. We also had to test the cables at the UL lab in Chicago which added quite a bit of cost along with being fit on a schedule.  On the flip side  the whole point of computer simulations seems to be that we can run many trials quickly and cheaply on a computer. Unless it was some crazy large computer program  there would be no real need to do 300 vs. 3000 runs. Why not run the max?    Regards

The question posed at the end of the first video was: How might a teacher handle a discussion about the different claims made from these two groups?  In my opinion  I would have the two groups explain their claims and try to refute the other groups conclusions. I would have other members of the class chime in as well  agreeing or disagreeing  almost like a mock trial. I would facilitate the class  making sure the disagreement didn't become out of hand  and see what students could learn from one another.   At the end  I would probably give an example of how sample size matters that is extremely relatable  and would effect them. I thought it would be interesting to see how students would react to the following situation: Say I was grading homework and if I found that more than half the class did not complete their homework  I would give a pop-quiz. 10 students out of 30 did not complete their homework. If I take a sample that consists of the first student in each row  which contains 5 students and 3 out of the five did not complete their homework  is that representative of the actual percent of the students who did not do their homework? Of course the students would go crazy  saying that wouldn't be fair  and would compare it to the Schoolopoly activity  and ask them to reevaluate their claims in reference to sample size.  Im not sure if this is a good example of the effects of sample size  but it would definitely give students a better understanding that the larger the sample size  the more accurate the data.   Any opinions or input on how you would handle this situation? I'm interested in other approaches!!  Stephanie

So as I was   reading the assignment and playing with the Geogebra program  I was   thinking how can I get my kids to explore this activity.  I have   access to sets of TI-84 plus calculators that could easily have the app   Probability Simulator loaded.  In this app  you can modify the dice   simulation to the properties set by the company.  I figured that I would   borrow 12 calculators from our science department (math uses   TI-nspires) and set up the program so that 2 calculators represented   each company.  I would change the randseed prior to this so that the   calculator is no longer factory set.  Place sticky notes on each   calculator so I would know what company it represents.  This way I   can either have each student rotate stations and explore each company   or I can assign 12 groups to explore the company.  Which one I would do   would be dependent on the size of my class.  In the app you have   access to multiple ways to explore the data and when you exit the app   you have access to the last data as it is stored on the calculator.

I thought it was interesting that the AP kids came up with the wrong conclusions using the hypothesis testing. I also stress from the beginning of the year of the importance of sample size.

For the students to be able to simply plug in a number of trials and have the information generated for them in seconds is simply amazing.  It will afford them the opportunity to provide some very significant evidence when coming up with their final statements and inferences.  It also lets them 'play around' with different numbers of trials so they can see the impact o the sample size.

I can explain the Central Limit Theorem all day long  but having them run an applet or simulation just makes it so clear quickly.

The communication and different display options that the technology afforded students allowed for much better conceptual understanding.  I appreciate that we are shown some free pieces of dynamic software.  I do a lot of technology on the calculator  but the dynamic software is so much better for seeing mulitple representations.       For The Schoolopoly task  I really like the richness of the activity.  I think great tasks that can be used to teach multiple concepts are great because it takes less time to introduce the task later and the students already have a referent when we come back to it.  I hope to use it during our probability unit when we are investigating the law of large numbers and then I hope to revisit it for testing next semester.

The more testing is done  the possibility of the testing to be closer to reality.

I did this because I really encouraged them to talk and to help each other discuss about the Math. Also  I assigned them by mixing them up  an A/B student  with a C and a D/F student seated together. Hence the tri-seating is quite heterogeneous. And I instructed them to always ask themselves and each other these questions with every Math problem that they discuss: Why?  Visualize it!  Prove it!  How come?  What about this?. Now  going over the different stages of the SASI framework  they are asked to Pose Questions  Collect Data  Analyze Data  and Interpret Results. In doing so  and with the way that they are seated and partnered together  their being heterogeneous would delve them into the varying degrees of understanding and sophistication presented in the SASI framework. I just felt that reminding them about these concepts and frame of mind time and again would really help them develop those necessary habits of the inquisitive mind.

The ladies in the second group went to multiples of 6 (36 rolls)  as well; however  the ladies stopped there.  The boys continued up to 3 000 rolls.  I liked this because it shows that the boys were willing to \go the extra mile\"" to come to a conclusion about the data.  While one said \""fair\""  the other one was wanting to see more data.

This year is my first time teaching Statistics along with Pre-Calculus and AP Calculus. All require a lot of planning. It takes time to check out which one is more doable in class given some restraint at my school on technology and computer lab usage and whether students can do the activity at home. The videos and panel discussion are all helpful  learning how to pose questions  generate class discussions  engage students  and how to teach statistical concepts using 21st century tools at three different levels.   This activity can be applicable to my teaching. It is not a sophisticated activity. The activity can reinforce the concepts of sample size  variability  expected value  bias  probability distribution  and how to present their work graphically  numerically  and write up a statistical analysis. Students have not been introduced to chi-square testing or any hypothesis testing at this time.

I find myself running into issues with getting students to use precise language and notation.    I think that  for years  there has been a movement in the math community to make math \palatable to the masses\"".  We have used cliquey phrases and all kind of strategies that allows divergence from mathematical process and language; \""The answer doesn't matter - just the process you used\""; \""we don't need to know our multiplication tables - you can use your calculator\"".  I have to say I have been guilty of this myself sometimes.  What harm does it do if a little rhyme helps a student remember what to do?  However  when we get to upper level math  and we are preparing these students to go on to college  It is part of our job to raise the bar on the precision. It can be very difficult.  My only advice is to insist on the language.  I coach my kids on the language consistently  repeatedly.   I always ask my students to repeat their answers using the language of math.  I spend a huge amount of time grading papers with coaching comments and I reduce a grade if there is specific language I expect and is missing.  Students always have the opportunity to earn those points back and for the majority of them  after having to do the corrections a time or two  they start to pay more attention to it up front.    """

To be honest  there is no absolutely correct answer for that  and the answer varies for different situations (i.e. sample size  # of possible outcomes  etc.). On the other hand  as big mathematicians Bernoulli and Poisson described it  LOLN (Law of large numbers) just tell us that as we keep repeating the trial  we will converge to the theoretical probability. So  the benefit of having a chance of running as much trials as we can  fits to LOLN. In hands on activities  though  I have no idea how to generalize a plausible number for trials to be 'enough'.

I like to talk with my students about the significance of the decisions we are making vs. the cost per trial. Dice that are off by a few percentages may not affect the game too badly  and no one would get hurt. With software providing thousands of trials in moments  it takes a negligible investment to gather thousands of trials. Of course  do the trials. What if each roll of the dice required a monetary investment that came out of the profits from the game? Now we have competing interests when we decide how many trials to run.

I did find it interesting that they mentioned choosing a   multiple of 6. I would rate them at a B in collecting data. For   analyzing  the one student really wanted to see an additional type of   representation-pie chart-to help clarify his thinking  si I would also   rate him as a level B in analyzing. In the high school group  I too  was   baffled that they only chose 100. Because of that  I give their data   collection a B rating. By using the goodness of fit test  I would give   them a C in the level of sophistication. With the SASI framework  I   like how it never mentions age or grade level. I feel it's a continuum   that students  depending on the context  can move back and forth   between. If they get to a harder problem  they may not know how to   exactly collect the data without bias and ensuring randomness. But with   an easier experiment  that may be more obvious to them.

I thought the difference in thinking was interesting between the young set and the older set of students.  The younger ones used the multiple representation allowed with the software while the older students used just computational methods.  My stats book repeatedly tells us to draw a picture of each type of data before we transform it with computation so we can see what the data is saying.

I wholeheartedly agree that it is necessary to make sure students understand what is being modeled in a software tool and how it maps onto the real scenario. I actually spend time with my students discussing real scenario---&gt;experiment with real objects--&gt; simulate real scenario with new objects  and all along making clear the assumptions.      For example  for simplicity  let's talk about a real scenario of teams trying to make a decision on who gets to choose which goal to defend first by tossing a coin. There is a lot to unpack in that \simple scenario\"". are there only two options? are they equally likely? or close enough that we can assume they are? how do you assign which team will be heads and which team tails? winner of the toss is determined by which face of the coin is facing upwards.  This may sound silly and simple.....but I claim this is not simple for early learners.  If we want to do an experiment of this scenario  what is a trial? how many times doe we want to do a trial? what are we looking to examine by repeating the trials?  We experiment with this real scenario if we use a real coin t carry out the scenario.  Know  suppose we don't have a coin available?  Could we SIMULATE this scenario another way?  we need something that can help mimic the original scenario. If we want two different outcomes  we could consider using a two colored spinner that is half white and half red. we could also put a rock in one of our hands and put our hands behind our back  move the rock back and forth between the two hands so the placement is unknown  and then the \""player\"" has to choose a hand.  In either case  we are SIMULATING the coin toss scenario using a different model---and students need to be able to argue why that new model is a good representation of the original scenario.    Of course then we could always simulate by setting up a model using a pseudorandom generating function in a technology tool.   Even though in the schoolopoly example the model ahd already been created for the students (and hidden)  it is also important for stduents to experience creating their own technology-based models to run a simulation.  I talk about this more in a chapter in the following book  if anyone is interested. This is actually a great book to consider the different ways technology cna support reasoning across topics in high school mathematics.    <a href=\""http://www.nctm.org/store/Products/(eBook)-Focus-in-High-School--Technology-to-Support-Reasoning-and-Sense-Making-(PDF)/\"" target=\""_blank\"">http://www.nctm.org/store/Products/(eBook)-Focus-in-High-School--Technology-to-Support-Reasoning-and-Sense-Making-(PDF)/</a>     I'd love to hear what others think about the modelling process I described above.

It didn't only ask students to provide claims but also asked them to support their claims with some statistical evidence. This helped students to reason at different levels of statistical sophistication. The discussions they had within their groups also made them to emphasize on how a collection of data helps them to get to the right answer. The software students used had a great impact on their sophistication levels and made them to look for generalizations beyond the sample data  and gave them a chance to check the reasonableness of the data.

When I watched these videos and answered the question at the end  I knew that the high school AP students would be functioning at a higher level of statistical sophistication  but thought that the girls who had a larger sample size in middle school  Maria and Taiesha  engaged in a conversation that was highly sophisticated. They were not only able to connect the idea that sample sizes should be larger  but they noted the differences between theirs and Dannie and Laura's conclusion. They backed up their claims with sufficient evidence and understood the effect sample size had on the percentages. I was impressed! Here  I thought the conversation with peers was most critical.   I thought that when students were interacting with the technology tool  they were thoroughly engaged. I think about this activity for students with ADD/ ADHD and think of how well they would interact with the lesson. This activity was meaningful and I think can be used as a discovery lesson to show students the impact sample size has on data.   According to the SASI framework  the middle school students functioned at the C level overall. They began to notice the effect of sample size at the collect phase  modeled the data in more than one way (pie chart vs bar chart)  and made a general claim from the sample to the population.

It was a math class and we were rolling die to see how close we could get to the theoretical probability. I remember we had to roll the die 100 times and tallied the result. A class period went by very quickly before in depth discussion or argument could take place. Now that with the technology  our students can use a much bigger sample size. It is so cool to see the bars differentiate themselves as sample size increases. I think the video also reflects the realistic situation that some student (Manuel) wants to jump to conclusion quickly to complete the task  but the pair setting helps them to affect and stimulate each other to go further.

Having very little experience myself  seeing the levels is much better than just reading about them.  The thing that I realize is that statistical maturity differs for students--at all grade levels.  I am not at the maturity level that I would like to be but am working on it.  What website/tool was used to make the videos? Those would be a great way for students to show understanding as either an informal of formal assessment.

There's nothing like being able to easily analyze data  see the statistics quickly  and be able to make graphs/plots of large data sets. You simply cannot put large data sets into a calculator easily.    I use JMP from SAS. I really like it  but I'm sure there are other great packages out there as well.  Good luck!

I find it does save a lot of time. I agree that unfortunately  the students get lazy and only punch in the numbers to get the answer. When I taught it in the past using tables  etc it forced the students to learn the concepts a little bit more. Ideally the calculator should be able to allow more time to focus on interpreting results. Excel is also a useful tool.

To understand this background let me be a bit more specific about the adult learner. At my university there are many persons who need to work empirically and thus need to incorporate a statistical analysis to there paper. Very often these persons had statistics in the past  but they do no more feel fit to do a statistical analysis. So they are coming to my courses which are offered by our university.

How interesting.       I also appreciated your comment about the time limitations on learning statistics faced by working adults.  My students are working adults who are also attending graduate school  which means that they need concise information in a readily understandable manner.  Another consideration for working adults who are also students:  My students approach learning statistics from the point of view that they need to know the practical implications of what they are doing.  None of them are interested in statistics purely for the thrill of understanding the statistical theory underlying what they are doing.  They want to know if it the analysis is valid but not the theoretical basis of WHY the analysis is valid.  This may appear to be troubling from the point of view that they are learners because  as learners  it can indicate lack of academic investment.

They don't need to learn to read the theoretical  mathematics-based peer reviewed literature.  They can hire a dedicated statistician to answer the theoretical questions.  """

We have developed a database of dragons  which is simulated data  from which we have generated data cards. We aim to develop lesson plans to support teachers in using them.  I've included our proposal here:  Rationale  Data cards have been shown to help students of all ages to understand better the multivariate nature of data  and to facilitate a wider range of displays and graphs. We have developed a database of 180 green and red dragons  with information about various attributes  that are all printed on small individual cards.   Primary (Elementary) school teachers are often reluctant to teach statistics and feel unprepared. In addition they tend towards teacher-led activities. We are hoping to promote more student-led activities to learn statistics through our dragon cards. One way to do this is to provide lesson plans that enable teachers to be successful in teaching the specified material in an enjoyable and engaging way.  Goals  Create a series of lesson plans (probably 3 x 1 hour lessons).  Engage classroom teachers so that the plans get trialled and feedback.  Build relationships with teachers to develop the use of the cards further.  Planned Content  We aim to relate the use of the data cards to the ideas of data representation in the NZ curriculum in levels 1 to 4  which is similar to the CCSS up to about Grade 8.  The main focus will be on   1. helping students develop good statistical questions that can be answered using samples of the cards  2. getting students to explore different ways the data can be represented using the cards  or more formal graphing methods  3. helping students recognise that different samples will be different  but mostly give similar results.  Development Schedule  Weeks 1 and 2: Engage with other teachers and brainstorm on ideas for the lessons  Read up similar lessons from the resources in this course and elsewhere.  Week 3: write the lessons  Weeks 4 and 5: Get teachers to critique  and hopefully trial the lessons and provide feedback.  Week 6: Write up the final lessons ready for use.

Taking that into account  here are my questions:  1. What time frame  do the students have to complete this?   2. How long is each class period?  3. Do the students know the terminology that is used in all the questions? - I would have to reword many of the questions because I have used different terminology.   There are a lot of analyzing questions. Are your students able to do this type of critical thinking in other activities?     I hope this helps

You seem to have organized your thoughts well and have put a significant amount of effort into the project. My only suggestion might be that since it is a large project  be sure to allow sufficient time for completion and break down learning objectives so that your students won't feel overwhelmed at the outset with what you are presenting.  Thanks!

Yes my English is not my first language. any way here are my answers for your questions  my students will work as a teams of students and just yesterday i have uploaded my project for them. Most probably i will receive their answers within maximum ten days since we are going to take exams next week.  each class period takes around 1.20 hour and of course we cannot finish withing just one class since i have many topics in the syllabus i have to cover by the end of this month  All terminologies are very well known by my students. Most of students are able to do this type of critical thinking in other activities but some topics such as the confidence interval didnt given yet.  Would you please correct the sentence and the grammar as possible as you can. I will be highly appreciated your kind corporation and helpful

I liked the notes on horizontal regression lines and correlations close to 0  which could really help students understand that in situation the linear model provides no additional information about the response. You mentioned having students collect data  which would be a great way to get students to relate to the project and visualize the regression. Did you have any specific data or data collection activities in mind?  As an extension  I think that if time allowed  it would be interesting to have students collect several sets of data  each of which represented different types of relationships between X and Y (e.g.  horizontal/no relationship  linear relationship  nonlinear relationship).

I give students the freedom to select any data sets they want. I usually guide them to search for data sets that are related to the area of study they will pursue in college. All of my students in my AP Statistics class are seniors so next year they will go to college. By the time they face this project  they already know how to transform data in case they come across with non-linear data. The rationale behind this project is not only to do research and perform statistical calculations but also to understand which models/variables are better predictors of a same response variable.

I'm guessing there is a negative correlation between time since earning credentials and usage of box plots.

Every representation has its difficulty for both the learner  the user  and the interpreter. Box plots can both show interesting features like variation  but can also hide features in a distribution like clumps! I do an activity in my class (shared with me by my colleague Helen Doerr at Syracuse Univ.) that gets students to think about this issue. There are 4 boxplots and 12 dotplots. The task is to make an argument for each dotplot which boxplot could be used to represent the same data set  or if there are NO boxplots that are re-representations of the distribution. Students have to sort these at their table in small groups and then we discuss in whole groups.  I have attached two word docs that have large and small versions of the graphs. As a matter of practice  I never keep an \answer key\"" so that I always have to freshly engage with the task each time I use it!  :-)   Here are a few resources for further reading.  related to school students learning to use boxplots:  <a href=\""https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~iase/publications/rt04/4.2_Bakker_etal.pdf\"" target=\""_blank\"">https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~iase/publications/rt04/4.2_Bakker_etal.pdf</a>  There have been several articles in the American Statistician over the years related to use of boxplots in the DOING of statistics  and several statisticians that have proposed variations of a boxplot for new ways to represent data.

I look forward to using the dynamic software to allow them to really see the differences in the information that various types of representations give so that they can make good decisions on which representations are most helpful in which situations.  It is something I have never given enough time to in the past and I hope I can find a way to fit more of those tasks into student activities.     Visualization is so important  and the box plots give a great picture of the spread of the data.

The best form of graphical data display depends on what you are trying to communicate about the data.  Box plots are good for showing spread in the dependent (outcome) variable in one \treatment\"" or condition (independent or predictor variable) compared to the spread in the dependent variable for another treatment or condition.  In this case  the treatment or condition was the mode of transportation and the box plot was appropriate for showing how the spread of the time to school data compared for the different modes of transportation.  If the goal was to show differences in the mean and whether the confidence intervals around the means overlapped (was there a significant difference between means)  I would choose another form of graphical display  such as a bar chart.

The box plot shows a clear and simple summary of the distribution of the results.  This visual is used to quickly obtain data from and can be easily compared to other forms or representations of data.  Many of my students are visual learners and I believe it is a highly effective way to summarize data.  One last positive note - the box plot shows outliers and this visual is a great way to explain to students outliers within a set of data.

My students would formulate conclusions based on data  inclusive of an explanation for the outliers. The box plot really do provide them a good visual.

Rather than counting  and possibly forgetting and mixing them up in the process  using the stem leaf helped the students group data properly. Then from there  we set up either a Histogram or a Bar graph or a box plot.     The Box Plot shows clearly how near the data is grouped together  or how far they are from the body as outliers. It really is good visual and something the students are able to interpret independently.

I think that it is important for students to spend some time figuring out typical ways to use data to best express the solution to their questions and then choosing the best representation to answer their question.  It should be part of their planning  to revisit the options and choose the type of graph that will best suit the context of the question.  I find that students  like most of us  find a favorite form and tend to use that.  I ask students to consider alternatives and mention why their graph choice outweighed other possible depictions.  It is a small addition to their process - but requires them to always be assessing their thought process and maybe some of them will compare the data in more than one graphical depiction and find notice something more or different about the data set.

The opportunity to learn with \interesting\"" data is sufficient to engage students and hopefully encourage them to take more advanced courses in statistics and research.  By your proposal  we would require students to complete the same work we expect graduate students to do; most aren't capable nor do they need that level of understanding.  I believe our job as statistics teachers is to expose them to the \""possibilities\"" of the tools available  make them think   and ensure they leave with a solid understanding of the difference between correlation and causation.

However it needs to be appropriate to the age of the students. Students need to be able to draw conclusions from their model back to the real-world scenario. If the scenario is too complex  then this can be a barrier to learning the statistical skill.

I see the value in exposing students to relevant  serious datasets. Learning to pose questions  clean data  analyze real data  and interpret results in the context of a real problem is one of the most valuable experiences a statistician should undergo. However  many of the real  societally-relevant datasets contain so many variables and observations that a K-12 student would be easily overwhelmed.   Having students collect data on shoe size  or some other 'fun' constructed task would yield a dataset that is much easier to deal with in a classroom setting. Many students might become interested in statistics from such exercises.  How do you think you could make serious  real-world problems accessible to students at all levels?   One possibility would be to take a subset of real-world data  do a bit of data cleaning  and present the subset of data to students. I do believe that many students are motivated by important  relevant problems  but those problems should be presented at an appropriate level.

I also think modeling good habits of mind to our students will help them to improve.  Adding more rigor to the process in which the students pose questions  collect their data  and finally interpreting and analyzing their results is key.     For my students I feel that context is the biggest hurdle for me to get over.  I want to show my students that the context of the data  how it relates back to the questions they are posing is truly one of the most important aspects of the process.  If the students can make a really strong foundation on context  and always going back to it  I feel that more advanced inferences and analysis will naturally follow.

A shoe manufacturer will want to know the distribution of shoe sizes to maximize their profits. They don't want to make too many pairs of a size that will sit on shelves forever while other sizes sell out.  Lake depth is an important consideration for environmental scientists and biologists  as it can have ecological impacts. They may want to know if the depth of the lake is cycling in a normal way. If not  there may be a problem.     I'm curious - your comment doesn't specifically mention teachers or students  so I'm not sure if you mean that nothing should be studied by anyone unless it has a direct benefit to society  or if you mean that teachers should not present statistical investigations to their students unless they lead to such benefits.  If you meant the latter - what serious topics do you think kindergarteners and first graders should be wrestling with? Or maybe you are referring only to older students - in which case  I wonder where the line is  when students must restrict themselves to only serious questions?

My students really enjoyed completing the Census at School survey (we did it at the beginning of the year).  They find it pretty interesting when we use their data -but it's not the most life shattering data there.  But we have learned a lot about it.  For instance  I don't think I had anyone do anything on purpose  but I did have one person say that they were 2903 cm tall.  It was a great to discuss cleaning the data and have a discussion about outliers - you can't just throw them all out  but maybe some that you know are wrong you can.  Not to mention  then they try to figure out who put that.  :-)  I didn't know  when I did it in August  that you can take data from the rest of the state  country  etc.  I think I'll add that.  We know that context is always important in stats.  But sometimes  I think it's helpful to learn concepts outside of those really heavy  meaningful contexts because some of the contexts could distract from learning the statistics through the investigative cycle.  I say teach the cycle with the 'silly' things  and then have students come up with their own meaningful questions and challenge them to find a way to collect data and analyze  interpret and draw conclusions for themselves.

At the middle school level  students are asked to make predictions frequently. After determining that variables are related and the results can be used to make reasonable predictions  students determine a likely range of shoe sizes for a person who is a certain height. Water levels can be used to predict drought status  drinking water availability  dam security  etc...  I think we will lose a lot of students if only serious questions with serious answers are investigated. Developmentally  younger students have a VERY hard time thinking outside themselves and situations that directly and immediately impact them. While we should foster the students ability to think beyond him or herself  learning statistical concepts within areas of interest might unlock doors that would remain closed if interests are not taken into account.   A lot of higher level thinking can take place within the context of gummy bears and cat sizes.  (Serious questions can of course be developed for those situations  too. Future veterinarians could use the cat data to investigate a possible health issue. I'm sure gummy bear manufacturers use all sorts of statistical information. While the improvement of the gummy bear would likely not solve a world issue  it might keep a business going.)

It's very noble to want to only investigate new ideas that will improve the world but is a bit ambitious for most. As long as students engage in the task and identify with it in some form then I'm happy with that. Worthwhile statistics should be meaningful  using the PPDAC cycle  and have a real problem/context to investigate but it doesn't need to be too ambitious if most of our students are to engage and achieve the learning goals. I like your examples of how 'trivial' investigations may actually have real use to particular situations. Later down the line when they are a bit older they can use their statistical skills to change the world!

The students always like to know what they answer is to a problem  and I think as teachers we feel pressure to provide neat solutions to the problems we pose.  But there is probably more value in providing problems that do not have a satisfactory resolution.  As a professional statistician I know most problems I see in real life fall into this category.  The question for most analyses is \is this good enough?\"" not \""is this correct?\"".   I have seen this discussed by teachers in other fields.  Too many students grow up expecting all problems to have an answer.  Thanks for the discussion  it's useful to have articulated this.  """

While I don't agree with the way some values we eliminated in one of the example videos  this section has stressed how vital it is for students to look at the data collected in a more meaningful way and use their knowledge of the way the data was gathered to decide which values to keep and which to discard (with a good reason of course). I know some tasks insist on students collecting their own data however this isn't always realistic given the time restraints etc we have so I feel that as long as they know how the data was collected  they are at least better able to make a call as to how to clean it  deal with outliers/ incorrect values etc. We have used Census at School as an exercise in itself on  looking to see if data is perhaps incorrectly input and getting the students to make statements as to why they might exclude values in reference to the population.

However  the data evolved from just North Carolina to all the the United States.  That adds different climate  and densities  etc. This adds to t question the validity of the sample. For example  I am sure that in a city like Boston  many students use the subway.     At the least  since Tinker Plots is a sophisticated tool and has a wide range of analytic ability  the students could have certainly increased the size of the sample and focused just on North Carolina.  In addition  in Boston and other similar cities  many people use bikes to get around  especially since that has been a hot topic nationally to promote health and carbon dioxide reduction. If most of the students in this school do not use bikes  that is fine  but it strengthens the argument for more local data.  I did like their reasoning of common sense to justify limiting the range of travel time from 3 minutes to 60 minutes. I have read that people in California often carpool for 6 hour round trips  so that they can live in places which are affordable for them. However  these are students and the designers of the study who obviously do not or would not commute more one hour.

For example  students wanted to compare two variables from Census at Schools data that looks at number of texts sent to age  but understood the limitations of it being offered to school-aged kids. They started brainstorming on their own how they would gather that data for adults  and will begin the process of gathering data on their own to answer/further their question in the coming weeks!

There were two AP Final Projects that were totally fun. One was a takeoff from Men in Black (Men in Stats) and the other was AP Stat Project 2010. They had music and humor which got my attention. This shows that statistics can be presented in a more engaging way. I wish this were part of any stat course. Most of the other reports wre dull even with colors and charts. For example  although I try my best to read annual reports  I have trouble staying focused.  I hope that  additional mediums  or at least humor can be added to statistical reporting make them more appealing to those creating them as well as those receiving them.

I am not in a situation as far as Statistics course knowledge goes that allows me to go beyond what I am comfortable with  and that is  looking at and working with solid data. But i do understand how it could go south with our students when they just continue to look at data. Something like as  you mentioned  humor and music would certainly perk up their interests.

Last spring  I taught statistics for the first time after having been a middle school teacher for the previous 8 years.  I used activities and data collection that allowed the students to be involved in their own learning.  As a result  I got behind and did not have enough time to teach all of the standards.  I do not know how to find a balance that will allow me to incorporate the entire statistical process during class. Hopefully  being able to use some of the tech tools provided in this course will make for quicker production of graphical displays that will allow me as well as my students to get to the analysis and interpretation phase more often.  The Census at School data base coupled with the tools can make for meaningful discourse and learning.

I have a very minimal experience in that I venture to teach basic Statistics to our AP Calculus students on the very last month of the school  right after the AP Calculus test. We would manage to go through the basics  just trying to get their feet wet before they go off for college or university. We would go through the Mean  Median  and Mode; the different ways of graphing; the stem-leaf and the box plot; and end the year with the Standard deviation. But I know there was way way much more to Statistics than just getting our feet wet. And this class has helped me a lot. It has opened my eyes  whet my appetite to know more and has actually given me tools and visuals that I know would help me a lot as we develop the curriculum. I thank you.     In the meantime  the School Census is really amazing  especially the interactive tools that is attached to the study. I had fun trying different scenarios. I definitely would make this as one of the eye-openers to my students to show the beauty of Statistics. And recalling the SASI framework  that too  developing a habit of inquisitiveness in the mind as well objectivity  impartiality and healthy skepticism woul;d go a long way to learning and shaping students' minds.

My students are in the upper level Math courses  however  I found this strategy very helpful for my Math vocabulary. This might help in the Math vocabulary development for ELD students. I ask my students to just focus on one Math word  or one Math concept they learned during the week's lessons. Then I ask them to make a Math Graffiti out of the word or concept  a drawing that would subtly depict what they learned. I emphasize that I do not just want a drawing  not a formula solution  not an essay  rather I want a subtle drawing of what they learned using the word or concept. Then at the back of the Math Graffiti  I'd ask them to describe the word or concept. It really helped in how they learned concepts  at the same time asking them to verbalize  in writing  whatever they have learned. Here several modalities of learning had been used.

Statistical language can be difficult to pick up as there may be similar terms with different meanings so we need to be very precise in our language and explain clearly what we mean so the students can then express back to us in their own words how they understand a particular term. We need to ensure that the students can write up their results and explain what they did as well as they can collect and analyse the data.

Many of my students have an intuitive understanding of the concepts we are teaching  but don't have the language to articulate them.  I like the idea of a glossary and this is something our students have requested in a recent staff-student meeting in our department (college level).   Lately I have been asking students whether they agree or disagree with certain statements early on in classes  and this has thrown up some interesting cases where common usage of words clashes with scientific use in ways I didn't anticipate.  'Cause' and 'risk' are common words where the meaning can change in subtle but important ways.

Sometimes they even can't or won't answer a question because the \right\"" vocabulary word escapes them at the moment.  However  oftentimes the right word isn't even necessary if one can explain the concept well.  I guess I'm just saying that I sometimes feel like I need to emphasize clear communication instead of vocabulary.  Donna """

One thing that has struck me in the last month or so is how much I feel like \Statistics for everyone\"" should be our mantra as well as that maybe statistics is the most important 'math' class we teach in high school - or at least the most practical for most of our students.  But sadly  that is not reflected in our new text series (common core).  I have been lamenting over the fact that my AP stats students really have not seen any statistics in any course they've had since Algebra 1.  If the curriculum has some sort of statistical type unit  it is often probability or simply making a scatter plot.  My students are seniors who haven't taken Algebra 1 since their 8th grade year  so we're talking about these students not getting any real world data for 4 years!  And I only teach about 15% of the senior class.  What I do think is fascinating  though  is that the texts that we have adopted that follow common core seem to be disconnected with what other national standards are wanting.  For instance:  I recently proctored the PSAT and the proctor booklet outlined that one of the changes to the test was that there was a greater emphasis on statistics since that is what colleges and employers would like to see in their graduates.  So  at least at our school  we're teaching 'less' statistics  but the students are tested more!     One thing I have thought a lot about doing  however  is to do a statistical literacy 'workshop' with my colleagues at school - math and non-math teachers alike.  MANY other subjects are using visual representations as well as other statistics - even confidence intervals - and I don't think everyone knows what they mean.  And  since we aren't teaching as much of this in the math classes  its even more important that when they get it in history or political science or biology  it's interpreted correctly.  If anyone has any ideas of topics I should include when I do this  please let me know!  """

I feel that stats should play a much larger role in all subjects.   Calculus should be dropped and stats put in its place.    I was forced to complete the entire series of calculus at the university  but no stats was required.  I expected to use calc as a Chemistry major  but it was rarely utilized.   However we continually used stats as part of almost every science course and very regularly as part of my masters program.   Statistics would have been very helpful.

Statistics can easily be incorporated and or related to various experiments  labs  and lessons where data can be collected  analyzed  and where conclusions can be drawn.  The grade level at which it is introduced can also be changed.  Why do students need to wait until they get into high school before they begin learning about statistics?   It could also lend itself to a nice disciplinary unit between math and science at the middle school level.

Our students get some instruction on data displays and 5-number summaries in Algebra 1 (typically 9th grade) and then see no stats at all until Algebra 2 (typically 11th grade).  Our courses are packed with way too many other objectives/standards that there is not adequate time to really do justice to the statistics standards.  Under the new CCLS we will have to rush to pack significant statistics material into about 25 instructional days.  On one hand  I am glad that statistics is getting more emphasis in the NYS Algebra 2 course.  On the other hand  due to time constraints  teachers will be forced to hurry through the stats material and many will resort to direct instruction  rather than take the time to allow students to explore and experience the entire data investigation cycle.    One idea I would like to explore at my school is offering an \Introductory Statistics\"" course as an elective.  We already offer a college level stats class  and it is gaining popularity every year  but many students are intimidated by the fact that it's \""college level\"" and don't signup for it.  I would like to look at the possibility of offering an investigations-based stats course that would allow even our slower paced and struggling math students to grow in their statistical literacy.   A nearby district offers such a course and they use a textbook entirely based on sports.  Using sports as a starting point could get a lot of otherwise disintersted students \""hooked\"".  Once students gain some skill and understanding of statistical concepts  they could branch out and explore data on other topics that interest them.    <span class=\""Apple-style-span\"" style=\""display: inline; float: none; \"">I am afraid that statistics will continue to get shortchanged if we continue to just pack it in at the end of an Algebra 2 course  rather than create a course dedicated to this impotant and relevant field. </span> """

In my school  I see students who are going to be doctors or will focus in careers related to medicine  psychology  etc and these students sometimes take AP Calculus instead of AP Statistics  which does not make any sense to me. There has been the idea that AP Calculus is \the class\"" to take. Many think it brings such reputation to the student records. There is still a great deal of confusion and I agree that students who want to become engineers need to take calculus but they also should take stats to increase their repertoire of mathematics knowledge. Administrators and heads of math departments should also get together to plan which students should take statistics. I have to say \""thank you\"" to the Common Core Standards for bringing more statistics and probability into our curriculum. We need to realize that high school students should not graduate without taking a Stats class  even if it is a basic stats class.    Additionally  it is so important that we as teachers get involved in great professional development (as this very same one) to increase our knowledge of stats and try to convince other peers of the importance of statistics in our schools.

Students should graduate from high school with statistical fluency  because everyone needs to be able to reason statistically  The first part really stuck out to me. It is a shame that all of our focus is on our testing system at the end of a school year. However  K-5 testing is usually in April  so why not engage students in statistics AFTER testing? I think students would be able to enjoy these lessons that much more ! :)  The second part stuck out to me as well. I never thought I used statistical reasoning in my day to day life. Then  I realized the habits of mind and reasoning that we use is most definitely taught in statistics.   What I would like to push for is a statistics course  all on its own  to be taught in high schools as a math elective. All that is offered now (around me at least) is an AP Stats class  which is only offered to the brightest students. We should give our lower level students a chance with statistics  for I think this would be a math class many of them would enjoy.  What would you like to see happen in stats education?  Stephanie

As you are aware  federal dollars are tied into the implementation of the Common Core and some type of testing whether that be PARCC or some other tool to assess student learning.  Moreover  in some states student success on these test are used to determine if a teacher is highly effective  effective  or developing. As a result  lessons and resources must be placed on teaching to the test.  Unfortunately  the time to include curriculum which is not assessed is very limited.  This is sad to me  teaching students to utilize the statistical habits of mind would benefit them now and in their future.

It is a shame that we don't implement a topic that will be useful to students not only in their day to day life  but also in just about any career that they choose.  I think for some teachers it is an issue of what is in the high stakes test  but some it may be a lack of confidence.

All of the resources shared in this course are exceptional tools to increase student learning.  As I stated before  I am a special educator and I co-teach Algebra I.  One of the resources I started to support my struggling learners is Google Classroom.  I post supplementary aids in the classroom for students to utilize at home while completing assignments or studying for assessments.  I will be posting links to many of the data resources shared in this MOOC-ED.  Thank you for helping me gain a greater understanding of statistical habits of mind  posing questions  analyzing data  etc.

These were interesting reads and share some insight to the nature  purpose  and background of the assessment; but they still don't address my concerns.  How reliable (e.g.  Cronbach's Alpha) is the instrument?  The test has been divided into two constructs.  How well do the questions align when forced through factor analysis?  What is the point-biserial correlation coefficient for each item to it's construct and to the overall score?

Seeing a number just doesn't sit well with me. If i was to see a breakdown or an explanation of why each answer was correct  I would feel more satisfied with the result I did get on the LOCUS quiz.  A suggestion that should be told to the LOCUS company is to better navigate between questions. If i wanted to check my answer for the very first question  it seemed like I would have to keep hitting the \back\"" button  and then hit next to get to the last question. Perhaps a drop down list with each question number would be more helpful. This would give students more opportunity to go back and check their work more easily if this was available to them for a homework one night. """

That is  much like the current economic model for online shopping (i.e.  everybody in the community has the opportunity to rate and contribute to a validity index)  we could have global access to ALL of the papers and not just the ones the <a href=\""http://www.ted.com/talks/ben_goldacre_battling_bad_science\"" target=\""_blank\"">screener's</a> wish for us to see.

We have designed a lot of the activities so that you can use them with your students as well. So the LOCUS is meant for you to take to gauge your own understanding of the statistical content that students are expected to learn either in middle school or high school/college depending on which test you choose. The LOCUS assessment is designed for use with students but also teachers in professional development experiences. Does this help clarify?

Perhaps we Canadians use different terminology to describe statistics than the creators of this LOCUS.  Did anyone have the same experience?    I was so tempted to open up my online dictionary at certain questions but didn't.  So I'm wondering if my problem is also a problem for students.  The site mentions the use of calculators but no other learning tools.  Would allowing students to use a class word wall or glossary of terms help them demonstrate their conceptual understanding of these concepts more fully?

The level of statistical understanding in the Indian education scenario is pretty my limited to reading from the textbook and doing the questions at the end. The central tendency questions are easy as long as they are straight forward and direct. Any application based questions will pose a challenge to a majority.   A lot more needs to be done here starting at experiencing statistics at the early school years and becoming comfortable with handling numbers and their interplay. Its more of a systemic shift required. A lone teacher can only do that much. Having said that I do agree one has to start somewhere....it might as well be wherever I am.

The most common statistics that students can see in their daily lives is the statistics regarding US election that is coming in November.  Second  when I teach the concepts in statistics  I will just not teach the concepts  but also I will try to give the statistical tasks that applies the concepts.

Kids do need a lot of practice  but I think it's a different kind of practice than it used to be when students asked to repeatedly calculate the mean or range. These types of questions require the student to really develop a habit of making sense of the data and questioning it. I found myself thinking closely about how one might interpret the data differently  or how the data collection methods might impact the results of the data. This would be what we hope kids do --- even when they read a post on social media or watch a statistics given on the tv.

It is important also that students are taught how to think critically and learn how to interpret the data.

I'm currently developing materials for NCEA Level 1  and I'm moving away from the assessment-based grouping. The first section is Statistical Analysis  and reminds students of the statistical enquiry process etc  rather than just focussing on what is needed for the assessment. We assess too much and assessment dominates our teaching when it shouldn't. Some schools are moving to reduce the number of assessments.

In an ideal world there would be no time restrictions for learning and exploring statistics  but the reality is that in the limited time available we focus too much on the 'skills' rather than the true understanding and appreciation. I teach a variety of ages (Y7-13) and with younger students it's nice to have the freedom (to a certain extent) to experiment more  rather than making sure they know enough to achieve a particular grade at NCEA.

My experience as a non-educator is that data interpretation skills are sorely lacking even among professional scientists and engineers. I was a bit baffled by this when I first started out in my career  to be honest. It took a few years of being the \Facility Statistics Nerd\"" to get a grasp on why these professionals were satisfied with presenting various analyses (usually just printouts from Minitab or StatGraphics) with insufficient interpretation(s) -- or worse  why they felt confident presenting interpretations that were in direct conflict with their data!  The root cause in my facility was that many of these engineers had learned statistical concepts during one or two classes as part of their undergraduate careers  but hadn't applied the concepts to their daily activities in over a decade (or several decades  in some cases). Without continuously using these tools  they felt at ease with accepting pre-packaged data analysis at face value. It's been quite a challenge to foster the \""unlearning\"" of that sort of behavior.  <span style=\""line-height: 1.42857;\"">Similarly  their deliverables (validation reports  lab reports  etc) never required a \""Discussion\"" section. The reports went straight from \""Data Analysis\"" (usually  again  just printouts from a statistics program) to \""Conclusions\"". I imagine most of our MOOC classmates have seen similar issues with their students. I'm absolutely open to ideas on how to foster that change without an iron fist!</span>  """

Our students are trained on the procedures of doing stats but their conceptual understanding of each method and how to interpret the results are still weak. Some of the questions may look common sense but even common sense is something that needs to be introduced early on. If we don't let the elementary students expose to stats and learn it in a way related to life we can't expect them to answer these questions when they get to middle school.

I firmly believe that as educators we should experience what our students experience and walk a mile in their shoes so to speak. The reality check of experiencing exam pressure and the unknown makes us better as teachers because we are able to empathise with the students and what they are going through. It also reminds me to explicitly teach problem solving strategies as well as course content which better prepares our students for their lives going forward.   I have not come across some of those more higher level statistics terms/skills in that assessment since I was a student myself and it made me realise how much more I still have to learn before I can confidently teacher higher level statistics. I think the way I approach teaching statistics will be altered in terms of teaching students how to interpret the problems a lot more explicitly and working through problems using highlighters  looking at the wording in particular.

Don't feel incompetent because you don't know all the answers.  Use the opportunity here to gain a group of colleagues you can ask when you need help.  And don't forget - when you don't know the answers  ask the students to help teach it.  You'll be amazed at how they can really help you understand better.  Just remember  you don't have to have all the answers - ever.  Certainly not at this point.  """

What an incredible learning opportunity for me as a teacher because I got to grow WITH my students.      I taught in a district where I was the only statistics teacher (and  at the time  there were only about eight AP statistics teachers in the entire state)  so Twitter became my \""math department\"" when I needed advice in stats.

When I took the middle school test  I too was struck by the focus on fundamental understandings rather than formulas and calculations. I'm glad to hear that the high school test was similar. I am teaching a high school statistics class for students in a special education program. My plan going into the course has been to focus on concepts and use software to lighten the calculation load.  It's comforting to see that my class will be more in line with the standard expectations than I had realized.

I am so much used to work with the computer programm that it was nice to answer questions without any tool. And it was a challenge too. As a non native English speaker I can also say that there is a language barrier. It took me quite some time to read the question in order to understand them correctly. I say this because I think it can be a regular issue for foreign students in any one country.

I have heard others (at professional conferences) make note that he reading level expectations on the test may be a barrier and confounding variable.  However  in general  I think the items give a good gauge at conceptual understanding (all validation and reliability testing was done on US-based students). They do ask a question as part of their demographics as to whether english is your native language.  Thus  I think they are going to do further work in this area.

As I read through each question  I reflected on the importance of disciplinary literacy in addition to conceptual understanding of the topics involved.

The students need to be able to explain what they have done and why  as well as do the analysis. This would involve discussion and writing about statistics. Not only would it help them answer the questions  but would also deepen their understanding. Often understanding grows as we write about things.

After considering how much of that material I felt that my students should be able to answer accurately  I began to feel better about my ability to teach Stats.  My AP Statistics students would be able to correctly answer most of the questions on the assessment  but I am positive that almost none of the students in my school would be successful at answering most of those questions unless they take AP Statistics.  This reflection brings me to the question of just how much our students actually understand statistics.  I believe that it is important that everyone have a basic understanding of statistics  but I don't think that we are doing a very good job as teachers of helping students understand statistics.  My personal opinion is that teachers are not comfortable with statistics themselves; therefore  they don't do a very good job of teaching the material  often skimming concepts just enough to say they have covered it.  I am taking this course in hopes of being able to help other teachers in my school and district be more prepared to teach statistics.

I loved watching the video where the Year 8 students were all invested in learning. They were contributing to the discourse. They were using their reasoning skills and making inferences. Statistics came alive for them  because it was so interactive they were able to manipulate the variables and see the change over time. This would be a great way to introduce them to statistics in everyday life and how prevalent it is around us.

I have found that my students generally understand what types of questions can be answered from data that has been gathered and also how to collect data to answer a particular question (if the question isn't too difficult or too esoteric).  However  students generally have difficulty understanding the idea of variability even though they can usually compare two distributions in terms of center  shape  variability and other distinct features after being taught how to do so.  I have also experienced that they have difficulty with conceptual questions like the one that was meant for a person to tell whether a difference of 2.5 was statistically significant by looking at a dot plot of 100 simulations.

Oftentimes we teach students the procedure of a test to perform and the computations to do so  and not really what the test is \testing\"". After I have used simulations and empirical sampling distributions with students (and teachers)  they DO tend to walk away with a much greater understanding of why/when a certain value should be considered significant---because the probability of it happening is so low.  If you are a member of NCTM  I have an article in the Mathematics Teacher that explains an engaging activity for students on this concept.  <a href=\""http://www.nctm.org/Publications/mathematics-teacher/2014/Vol107/Issue6/Connecting-Research-to-Teaching_-Using-Data-to-Motivate-the-Use-of-Empirical-Sampling-Distributions/\"" target=\""_blank\"">http://www.nctm.org/Publications/mathematics-teacher/2014/Vol107/Issue6/Connecting-Research-to-Teaching_-Using-Data-to-Motivate-the-Use-of-Empirical-Sampling-Distributions/</a>        """

Now this is only my third year teaching stats (feels like my second because the first year I felt like I was learning with the kids!) I feel like every year there is a struggle with understanding what standard deviation and variability is. They can calculate all these values perfectly but when I ask  what does that tell you about the data  I get blank stares. If anyone has good ways to help understand these concepts conceptually instead of procedural  let me know. I love hearing how other teachers present these topics!

Reading comprehension is difficult for many of these students  so reading and understanding the questions can be as much of a hindrance as the math and calculations.  In the past I have taught a wider variety of students and I think that most would have been able to answer the majority of the questions by the end of their high school career if they were given a solid foundation that was built on through out their time in school.  Since the majority of students don't take AP Statistics  the statistics that they are exposed to is only a part of their math courses  so repeated spiraling instruction would be needed to.  I didn't score as well as I would have liked to  but I have not had the repeated instruction or use of statistics to quickly and easily be able to answer the questions.

It is very interesting going through these questions however  they really make you think  and consider the wording of the entire question thoroughly.  To prepare my students for these questions  I myself would have to rely less on surface level questions and ask more thought provoking questions.  I think they key here is that students can visualize two or even three correct answers to each problem  and to assist them  I would like to have partner or class discussions on what makes an answer more \correct\"" than others.  Discussions to see what key words make that answer incorrect given the context.  It is interesting as well  because I think it really opens the student's mind to what is possible in the outside world beyond the experiments given in the practice test.

The chance of guessing the right answer is the inverse probability--that is if there are 2 answers you have a 1/2 or 50% chance of a right answer.... if there are 4 answers you have a 1/4 or 25% chance of a right answer by chance. If you calculate each probability for each question in the quiz and average them  that's the score you should get by chance. If you got half of them right  given there were more than 2 answers for each question  then you are certainly doing better than just guessing!  As for learning more on statistics  there are many stats courses out there  I'm hesitant to suggest other online course providers within one of those course providers...but taking an intro course builds a good foundation. It sounds like you are practicing statistics actively  which is good  but it can also mislead your development (why you should have a firm foundations). If you don't take a course  I encourage you to spend extra time in your work to think more deeply about what you are doing using your software that does all the work for you. A student can use a calculator for addition and not learn addition  unless they are actively thinking and reflecting on what numbers go in  and what comes out and why. Essentially you need to develop intuition  in other words  get good at guessing the outcome before you press the buttons.   Good luck  and don't be so hard on yourself.

I guess I may have read questions too quickly without thinking as critically as I should have. This is exactly what we have to transfer to out students. We need to teach them how to critically analyze before they answer questions.  It is also important that we deliver questions that are not ambiguous. I thought a few questions on the assessment were not good questions and could have been more clear.   I am so looking forward to share ideas with other professionals and become and better instructor.

I think that too often we focus on vocabulary as individual mathematics and statistics words  and think that if students understand the individual words they will be able to understand the test questions.  In fact  understanding test questions is often about interpreting the little words like \to\"" or \""if\"" or \""not\""  as well as the statistics words. """

For the students teach (college) these questions are difficult/tricky because the see Statistics as a math course and only want to focus on calculation. However they want to study Statistics because it is practical which means they need to focus on the conclusions they can draw from their calculations. To draw the proper conclusions they really need to focus on the language they use and this is where they run into problems.

Almost all of the students assume that it's going to be a \typical math class\"" with lots of practice problems where they need to find an answer to a problem (usually students tell me that they'll be calculating mean  median and mode).

There needs to be more statistical contents infused in high school mathematics. Most students at the post-secondary level are required to take an introductory course on statistics in order to fulfill their degree requirement (quantitative reasoning).

Their informal knowledge appears to be far from the standards mentioned in the 9-12 NCTM content standard for probability and data analysis.

Maybe think about using the four phases (or five phases as it is often used in NZ) of an investigation to help them structure their report. I would love to see you develop a resource focused on using dot plots for analysing quantitative variables and comparing distributions. One thing that I do to help support the move from analyzing univariate dot plots to comparing distributions is that I use software that have the capabilities of recoloring case icons by a categorical variable. For example  see the series of graphs below of the city miles/gallon rate for a random sample of 300 vehicles manufactured in 2015 (data from https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/download.shtml).   Giving students a chance to analyze the top one and to consider the trends they see in center and variation  usually brings up a wondering about the vehicles that seem different from the center clump. I encourage them to click on those data icons and inspect those vehicles and see what they may have in common. Eventually someone suggests that they seem to be hybrid cars  so we overlay the variable Hybrid (second graph)  see hwere those vehicles are in the overall distribution  and then eventually separate them by putting Hybrid on the y-axis for a better view and ability and to compare the two distributions with certain measures (not shown).  Hope this helps give you ideas!  I'd love to hear what you think as you develop your resource. :-)  <img src=\@@PLUGINFILE@@/example%20dotplots.JPG\"" alt=\""three graphs\"" width=\""723\"" height=\""721\"" style=\""vertical-align:text-bottom; margin: 0 .5em;\"" class=\""img-responsive\"">  """

I especially feel like in other courses  statistical concepts are the ones that are left out when we run out of time.  So for my AP stats students  I assume they can do things like read graphs and that's about it.  This tool might be a great way to find out what conceptual understandings they might have.  Also  I find that a lot of the problems I use for student assessment are asking for work and long explanations.  They aren't bad problems  but it would be easier to identify misconceptions from looking at common wrong answers from a multiple choice test.  The multiple choice portion of the AP exam is the area I seem to have the least amount of resources for.

The experts in the video talk about how collecting and analyzing real world data is engaging for kids because it isn't a worksheet that is disconnected from their lives. I think this engagement necessarily forces them to think which is way more fun than being a formula robot. Anecdotally  my brother woke me up this week with an interesting geometry problem that made me think about circles in a new way and it was really exciting. Granted  as a math teacher I'm probably to the point where I can be excited about thinking about weird problems but I know that balancing my budget is significantly less exciting that solving weird problems that make me think.

Thank you for your reply!  Funnily enough  my students have found that connecting the context to their investigations is NOT the most difficult part. I thought that it would be. By Year 13 (12th grade)  they have become familiarised with Statistical Investigations by what is known as the Statistical Inquiry Cycle here in New Zealand and they are reminded throughout their school career from a very young age that it is important to link their results back to the context.  My students often struggle with the more difficult concepts and how they are related to their investigation. For example  resampling from a sample and confidence intervals. They also tend to mix up the vocabulary that they are trying to use even though their understanding is evident.  I give regular feedback to my students on their investigations (both written and verbal). I also ask my students to give each other feedback. My students have enjoyed having regular feedback in many forms so I do this as often as possible. They also like having exemplars that they can use as a guideline so I save previous student work (with consent) to use as examples in years to come since I am always updating assessments and using new contexts and datasets.

I was thinking that I would not have done as well during my first 3 years of teaching AP Statistics.  It would have taken me a lot longer and I am pretty sure I would have gotten several other items incorrectly.  It was around my fourth year of teaching the course when I started becoming comfortable with the topics.  And this is with a lot time for planning  more than I spent with any other Math classes I teach.  I would always come to class prepared and confident but with Statistics  I always have a feeling of \I know I can get a lot better!\""  There are so many resources out there and so much to learn  and I get so excited about them  sometimes I wish there were more than 24 hours in a day.  :-)  I have always believed that my students can only be as confident about the concepts I teach as I am about them.     Upon the recommendation of Mr. Darren Starnes during one of his presentations  I have been reading the book \""Make It Stick\"" and I like the idea of giving students assessments that spiral through the concepts learned and give it to them more often.  One recommendation of the book is for students to quiz themselves aside from the teacher quizzing them.  It would be nice to be able to direct students to sites where they can practice using their hand held devices.  Students should be exposed to a lot of MC questions as much as the free response.  I am grateful for the resources you direct us to.  """

I take comfort in your statement that it took a few years of teaching for you to become confident in your ability as an instructor of AP statistics; I've taught math for many years  but our state's recent implementation of the Common Core has reduced me to what feels like freshman status in statistics.

Do not be too hard on yourself.  Everyone I know who teaches Stats went through the same experience - it took a us while to reach our comfort zone.

Students never ask  \When am I ever gonna use this?\"" because they see it being applied since we deal with real/actual data.  You will do fine and you will learn to love teaching the course.

As such  (and since I don't know which items I missed  or even whether or not my missed items were guesses or items about which I was confident)  I can only hope I'm preparing my students sufficiently. I also took the high school level assessment (because I teach Algebra 1 to high-achieving 8th graders) and I did not do nearly as well as I did on the middle school test. I'm concerned but not discouraged  because I enrolled in this course to improve my understanding of statistics. I grieve a bit for my students from last year  though. It was our first year with our new Common Core curriculum  and only our second as a CCSS state. The responsibility is mine to better prepare myself in the area of statistics  though I'm pretty confident in most other strands of math. Adjusting has had its challenges  I must admit.  It's a little strange; I consider myself a reasonably strong teacher / mathematician  and I've been teaching math for over 20 years  but CCSS instantly escalated what I need to know (and to teach) about statistics to the extent that I actually <em>need </em>to supplement my field of knowledge. I hope this class helps.

The nice part of teaching statistics is that there's not a lot of calculations. It's really about understanding the vocabulary  knowing how to properly design a study or experiment and really understanding how measures of spread and measures of central tendency affect the data. I think plenty of reading  seeing different types of multiple choice questions  and seeing different kinds of experiments will help the students. Along with reading  students will need to be able to write and speak about their knowledge will help. If they can explain what happens in their own words  they can better understand the material.

Until now  I've taught at open-enrollment institutions where I could not assume that students had even a graphing calculator.  The textbook required for the class was chosen by mathematicians who were focused on the plug-and-chug  procedural aspects and would not consider most of these questions as legitimate assessment of what they teach in the course.

Even with the poor textbook and common final exam  we could get to some of these questions by the end of a semester.   <b>What would be needed to assist students in preparing to answer these   types of questions?</b>  The tool that I've only just begun to appreciate is that I can present displays of technology output and discuss what they convey <i>without</i> expecting students to have access or to use the technology themselves.  The data tools collected in this MOOC are (so far) my favorite part of the course!  I still think it will be best for students to actually use the technology and get their hands messy with data (which my new institution expects - yay) but questions like these at least expose students to the fact that 21st century statistics depends on software to do the math part.  It's up to the statistician to choose appropriate tools then interpret the crunched numbers.

These are difficult questions to answer since I am a student teacher and do not have my own classroom.  Although  I was a TA and tutor for an intro to statistics course for 3 years so I will reference these students I had.  Most of the students that I helped and taught  would have been able to answer these questions by the end of the course.  Some would still struggle  but I found that they did not put forth the effort to learn.  To me that can mean several different things  one can be that the examples and investigations students were looking at held no interest for them.  I think it is important for students to be interested in the data being presented so they stay involved and continue to want to learn more of the statistics.  I think if the lessons I presented my students did not have real data and they were not exploring the data through an investigation  then the results would have no meaning for them and they would not understand statistics.  I think students need to approach these problems like statisticians would  through an investigation  by doing it themselves  otherwise they take on the role of passive learners and do not learn all the can  which can mean that they are not able to apply the principles of statistics to other problems or sets of data.

However  I feel that writing good assessments for your students that help them get used to this kind of thinking will help them prepare to answer statistical questions. Focusing on concepts more than procedures is key in truly gauging their understanding. I would suggest though that multiple choice may not always be the best measure of student understanding.

Ask the students to create a graph  any graph  to represent data they collected  then have them examine the display critically. They may be able to tell you without even attempting to create one or more types of displays why that type of display wouldn't work in that specific instance.   You could also present a variety of graphs created to match data sets and have the students examine each critically for the pros and cons. Depending on how sensitive your students are to criticism  you may want to create the less appropriate ways of displaying the data yourself. My students always thought it was great fun to have full license to criticize the teacher.

It is always important to discover/learn/ become aware of our student struggles.  I am reminded of the Teaching Mathematics for Elementary School Teachers course I participated in at RIC. The professor made us complete all of our mathematics work in a base system other than the 10 base system so we would experience some of the struggles our students encountered learning mathematics.

As I perused some other responses I agree that the wording of questions can be a barrier to accurately assessing student understanding and possibly confounding their results with their reading level.  Other than exposing students to their text and as many A.P. questions as possible does anyone have any insights in how to encourage students to develop their reading?

On second thought however  I think you are correct.  It might be easier for younger students to start grasping at the finer points  the ideas of variability and manipulating data in a visual way if you give them the topic and data.  However  even very young students can talk about their interests and what questions they may have about that given topic  such as Cats  or dogs  or unusual pets  or you name it.     I feel that this can really apply to my high school class because I too fall into the trap of saying here is the data  find a line of regression.

This is a common practice but it comes with a price. This is an example of a qualitative analysis where a  cause and effect conclusion can't be made from the data; the students can only conclude that changes in the independent variable are related or not related to changes in the dependent variable but not that changes in the independent variable CAUSE changes in the dependent variable.  In a perfect world  they could have conducted an experiment with random sampling to collect their own data.

Students can use pre-existing data that's interesting to them to begin to learn to formulate questions. The same \interesting\"" data set can be used to explore different types of displays  pros and cons of each. Students can then take what they have learned from this exploration and begin to formulate their own questions and implement an appropriate surveying strategy.  Giving very young students (I'm currently working with 4th graders  but the bulk of my experience is in middle school) a blank slate for developing questions will yield...interesting...results. Giving them experience with data first will likely save a lot of time when they are asked to formulate their own questions.   """

I feel that statistics and statisticians can sometimes receive a bad reputation for what we just saw here.  The skewing of data whether intentional or not can really hurt business  politicians etc.  I remember a census group that was hired by Obama while he was running for office.  The census group reported back that he was well in the lead in a certain area.  Some news agency discovered that the census group was mostly young twenty-year-olds  and that they tended to poll people closer to their age  and neglect older voters.  This skewed the data in Obama's favor  and did not give Obama a clear idea of where to campaign.  My point is that good statistics happens all the time  and instances such as this give a bad name for statisticians.  I feel its important to teach students to be skeptic and to really address whether an observation can truly be removed.  As you said  there must be context  context  context!

I teach in the rural (desert) area and more than 60 minutes from school is probable because of distance. Now at the city proper  zoning is implemented and I believe that this is especially true in your urban/city areas. To my mind  the more than 60 minutes thing might be because of traffic  not distance from school. So because of this I think it was but right that they pared it down to 60 minutes. What baffled me is why they didn't include bicycling to school. Yes  in the initial data it was represented and I was surprised at the small percentage of its use. I surely thought it would have been more.

I think removing them is a valid method of dealing with them at middle school level  but I would encourage students to state the number of datapoints that had been removed  and explain why they had been removed when they were writing about their findings from the data. I think this helps them to consider the quality of their results and what purpose they can be used for. For students at more sophisticated levels of statistical thinking  I might encourage them to think about how we could manage the outlier in a different way  perhaps by imputing a value from another record that had similar responses for variables that are likely to be correlated with the outlier variable? At this level I would also encourage students to communicate how they set the boundary between outliers and acceptable values.

In my particular setting  learning a package of statistical software would be prohibitive due to timing  but some of these free online tools seem to have some of the flavor of these packages and we certainly have enough time to play around a bit.

The fact that the studied census was for \how to get to school  or what students use to get to school  then what is reasonable as variables would be distance from school and its proximity  and the viability of using a manner of going to school. Hence  walking  by car and by bus are the viable ones although I would also have include biking to school since especially in the U&gt;S&gt; schools are zoned by proximate locations of residences. And paring the travel time to a reasonable 60 minutes was very reasonable too  because in all probability  another school zoning area would be available for a student who lives a for more than a good 60 minutes away  except in rural  farming or desert areas.

In New York City there are many specialized high schools available to students living throughout the five boroughs. It would not be unreasonable for a student attending one of these schools to spend over an hour commuting to school  especially if they need to transfer to a different train or bus at some point on their commute  or if they are going to/from Staten Island.    To me  this brings up the importance of knowing your subjects and their experiences with regard to the questions you are asking. In the video  they pretty easily discarded the values over 60 simply because that situation is not part of their own experience. One needs to be careful in assessing the \reasonableness\"" of values  and not simply remove values because they seem unreasonable to you personally.  """

However  what I meant was that variables must be clearly defined. I intended to underline 60 minutes and ask under what terms the time frame is considered...was it by distance?...or was it by the manner of going to school? One could walk by 60 minutes  or ride a public bus by 60 minutes and entail a lot of stop-overs or one could go by private car for 60 minutes - non-stop. These variables are very much differentiated then.

My personal question was more of whether the time frame of going to school  in whichever and whatever manner they went to school  was dictated by distance or by the circumstance of going to school. A 60 minutes through freeway is different from a 60 minutes ride in city streets and/or through the countryside. I figured these would have been clearly delineated.

I felt that the time taken to get to school needed more information...Is it in city traffic or on open country highways?  I also thought of the age affecting mode of transportation. Once students get their drivers licenses  they will often drive to school if the school allows it.

I would assume that the sample of 500 was randomly taken from the student census data from across all age groups in NC. The question concerned student travel time in general rather than student travel time for a particular grade. This would certainly be a factor  however  if we looked at age/grade as a variable.    I did like how they refined the question under study as they looked at the data and narrowed the data set. One of the key tasks in analysis is deciding which data points to keep and which to exclude. This changes the analysis considerably.  Thank you for posing the questions!

I did ask students about travel time one year and observed an interesting tendency for the very short travel times e.g. 5 minutes  8 minutes  12 minutes  to be reported with higher accuracy than longer travel times e.g. 60 minutes  775 minutes  90 minutes.  2. I wonder about the day-to-day variability that is hidden when students report  as they do here  a \typical\"" travel time. I used to walk to university and once I had established that the walk took about 35 minutes  I could speed up or slow down so that my walk time took about 35 minutes every single day  as I would leave home 36 minutes before my first class every day! The point being  that a walk time is likely to be less variable than a car or bus time  as well as being shorter on average.  """

The thought process was evident in the video.    If my students were using the Census at School data  I would need to make sure that they were aware of their surroundings.  For example  do you really think someone in North Carolina is taking a boat to school?  Or is it likely that a commute to school takes 60 minutes?  In many areas of our nation  this information is possible.  I have several friends and family members who rode a bus for more than an hour to attend school; however  the school was not in their district and the city was much bigger (Texas  New York  and Massachusetts).  The students in the video did a great job at realizing the \far-fetched\"" data and continued to filter the results in order to make sense of it.  In my classroom  it would be beneficial to give my students background information on the sample population.

A class discussion over a set of research questions that can be answered by the available data would yield different outcomes from different countries/states.  Every paper/project/presentation would actually be substantively different even with the same question(s) and instructions.  This reminds me of the GapMinder lesson where students were comparing different pairs of countries.     As a student  I would be more interested in finding unique information for my project than in hoping I'm replicating the teacher's calculations just right.

Downloading a sample produces a massive spreadsheet  that kids organically see as overwhelming and immediately begin to cull the data they need to answer their question from. They are very interested in how they compare to others who participated  so they'll quickly notice things like typographical errors (students saying they are 17 meters tall rather than 1.7 meters tall) or questionable data that others might have input as a joke (spending 300 hours per week sleeping). It leads to great conversations at the very beginning of the year about how to clean data!

It occurred to me that cleaning up data is a valuable lesson that students must know in order to correctly interpret their findings and draw conclusions to answer their questions.  If my students were to work with Census at School data to investigate a question of interest to them  I think they would struggle with cleaning up their data to interpret their results. These students we were well informed about outliers  reasoning with school travel time and modes of transportation that were more frequently used. I would think my students would accept the data as is  and begin to draw conclusions using the raw messy data. I think this tool would be a great resource for teaching this type of lesson  and showing students how to make sure their data is meaningful in accordance to the context. The context of a boat in this case  was perfect. What student in NC would be using a boat? Definitely none. However  if students lived in New York City for example and traveled to school by use of a ferry  transportation using a boat would be more reasonable.  What would you do to help students understand what can be removed from the data set? How could you use Census at Schools to do this?  Stephanie  """

Not long ago we had a class survey for which someone entered their age as 220.  I was take aback by the large proportion of the class that did all project work without questioning this value.  Some decided for themselves that it was a typo and replaced it with either 22 or 20 (some admitted that the other option never occurred to them).  The number of emails and questions before class that asked my <i>permission</i> to delete that item from their work was both amusing and somewhat irritating.  A few students were bold enough to eliminate the mistaken response and put a note with their final work about why they didn't use it - statisticians in the making!

I think students would figure that they would find out what are the major forms of transportation and report on those. I think for  many students  the time they take to get to school may not be a very important thing for them so the outlier of the students who probably didn't take the survey serious makes sense.    Right now I am working on regression with my students and having them make determinations on what data to included and excluded is something that I am working with them on.  I think that students have trouble deciding what they want to investigate  hence on projects they always want to ask how to do the project but more like what are idea they can use to create the easiest project with least amount of work.  any ideas of how to guide students to help them engage in a project and  make it more relevant?

One of my previous careers was that of a school bus driver.  At each stop I was required to stop the bus  put on the flashing lights  put on the emergency brake  look through all of the mirrors to determine all of the cars had stopped  open the bus door  then pick up the microphone (which could be heard inside and outside of the bus) to tell the students it was now safe to cross the road and enter the bus.  After waiting for all students to get on the bus and take a seat and for the bus monitor to check under the bus and get on the bus again; I would then close the bus door and take off the emergency brake.  Next  I would check all of my mirrors to make sure it was safe pull completely back into the lane of travel and continue on my bus route. All of these actions increased the amount of time it took to get to school.  What is the purpose of this investigation?  I would want to know if the students with the longer travel time to and from school are impacted by the amount of time spent traveling each day.  What are the grades of the students with the longest travel time how do those grades compare to students with the least travel time? What behaviors are exhibited by students in school who spend the most time traveling to and from school? Are they more likely to exhibit behaviors that result in disciplinary referrals? Does travel time negatively impact the academic and behavioral performance of these students in school? On the flip slide  does longer travel time provide the opportunity for students to engage in preferred activities of talking to their friends on the bus or engaging in their electronic device to listen to music or play games and does this provide a beginning and end of the day relaxation experience for the students. Do these students have better grades and less disciplinary referrals?

When I  was familiar with the question and content being addressed  I got excited because I learned so much more from this class.  My score was a lot better!   My favorite lessons to do with my students is to collect data  analyze data  draw a scatter plot with a line of best fit  and draw box and whisker plots.  I know this might seem very minimal to many  however  it is a big deal to me.  :)

Same thing happened to me. I feel more confident in my classes  despite several years I dictate the terms of statistical ago.

That may not be as specific as you might like but it does capture the idea that they shouldn't need any more formal education to understand the statistics that they encounter in everyday life.  They should understand how numerical evidence <i>should</i> be treated and have some skepticism about how that evidence could be misleading if used by an entity with an agenda (like taking my hard-earned money or winning my vote).

Some students take AP Stats and some take statistics honors but these two branches are taught at the high school level. It is important that students are aware of how important it will be for them to know  for example  how to read data  read graphs  and analyze reports among other items. During the year I have multiple conversations with my students and I always emphasize the importance of being stats literate. I personally believe that knowing stats makes us use our common sense more and makes us be more analytical about many aspects of life.

Besides  and I teach AP Calculus  Statistics is a course that is and will be used by all disciplines while in college/university and more so when they start working   rather than Calculus. For Calculus  students that go to a STEM discipline in college/university would surely be an asset while learning it in the high school level. However  even if one go to journalism  to arts  to hairdressing or make-up classes  Statistics is a need and will be used both while studying and in their work later on.  I believe that Statistics should really be a course that is a \must\"" in high school. """

After going through AP training this past summer  I'm really trying to talk many students into taking the class. Right now in our school  those that take AP Calc also take AP Stats. With the FST(functions  stats  trig) class we offer   I'm hoping that I can talk more students into taking AP Stats  especially those who might want to take a math class but are scared of calc. The stats part of FST is coming up next week and I'm excited to use all of these new data sets with the students in order to get them excited to take AP stats next year.

However  I am rethinking <b>how</b> to teach.  One of my goals this year (even before I registered for this MOOC) was to decrease the amount of direct instruction in my AP Stats course and to increase student involvement.  Still working on this  but this course has given me many new resources as well as ideas.  (I hope my AP scores don't suffer.)   This year may be a little rough as I try new ideas for the first time  but I think next year will be better.

I like your goals for this year.  I feel like my confidence has increased from this course.

I dabbled on it when we finish our AP Calculus class right after the AP Calculus test  and it was just the basics  getting the Seniors' feet wet before they go on to university. Now  my principal has asked me to develop the program. I was hesitant  and anxious because I really don't know where to start  how to start. Now  I still am not sure about how to start  but the many tools this class has provided has given me some confidence to some try to build it the right way. This class was really terrific.

In the classroom I'll be looking to teach more within the PPDAC cycle rather than teaching mechanical skills (e.g. greater emphasis on posing questions  collecting data and interpreting data  while using ICT to do the calculations and visual representations). Well worthwhile taking this course.

I have nearly similar self-efficacy beliefs as I had at the beginning of the course on teaching statistical concepts  but this MOOC definitely changed how I think about how to teach statistics  what to emphasize on  and how to deliver it to students.  I don't teach statistics  therefore the only statistics teaching that I can make comparison to is the teaching that I got from my teachers  and it was definitely different! The statistics that I got in high school and higher education was only based on direct teaching of formulas and drill learning. After going through all the simulations  videos  and technological tools that are provided here I came to realize what statistics really is. It is much more than just the ability to read graphs or compute numerical results  but it is more about quantitative reasoning  figuring/analyzing the messy data  and building critical arguments. And in this process technological simulations are enormously helpful aids in making sense of the data  which I have never had chance to try it until participating this course!

If we get to the point where we are learning nothing new or at least thinking about how we teach our students  it's possible our own excitement will wane and our teaching will suffer.    I teach in a direct instruction school  so that is emphasized. I agree  however  that using real world data  allowing students to think through the problems  and challenging them at higher levels of Bloom's taxonomy is a good thing. I would suggest that you should keep your expertise in DI alive and healthy in your class. Do both! If what you have done in the past works  stick with it and nuance it with new things. You're AP kids will do fine with your guidance!  """

Some of us may be great statistics teachers however  it is important that we continuously learn about all the resources  websites  technology  etc that are out there for us to incorporate in our classrooms. As I took this professional development  I went back to my classroom and shared a few things with my students for the simple fact that I wanted to try new things and see how my students react to such new material. It is also important that we build a community of learners and share the wonderful stuff that we do to lead our students to be more successful in the future  especially by teaching them statistics the right way.  I teach high school and I am the AP Stats teacher at my school. My goal is not only to have my students pass the AP exam and obtain 3 college credits but also to make them like statistics in a way that they will choose on their own to take additional statistics classes. If that is to happen  then I feel I have accomplished my goal.

As current teachers and future teachers  we will not know everything there is to know about any course that we will teach. However  it is important to be knowledgeable and have an understanding for the topic. If we do not know a topic  we will research until a satisfied result is reached.   Is is important that our students have an overall knowledge of any subject they take  even if that means they do some research themselves  as this MOOC has shown us through videos and websites. It is just as important for us to know what we teach as it is for them to understand it in any way possible.     It's great that you have used some of these MOOC tactics in your classroom. How did they react? Did they do anything different?

I have usually been in an environment where we teach specific topics ie mean  variance etc  but the approach based around posing questions  so that the student can come across the various topics in the course of their investigations works much better  and is more interactive and I believe more memorable for the students. I'd love to adopt these methods but it does occur to me that it takes more time  even though it is a more desirable teaching method  and would  I believe  have better long term results. Unfortunately  time for teaching statistics is often limited in my institution. I have also become more aware of the gap between understanding a topic oneself and being to explain that topic to students  and pitch it to the correct level of understanding  especially when students are being prepared for assessments  i.e. exams and course work  projects etc. This course has been very helpful and interesting  and if it was to be extended in any way  then some specific mention of how best to assess students in different setting would be very useful.

I feel my confidence for teaching statistics has definitely increased. Through the videos  discussing and asking each other questions  I feel like  have learned a lot  especially for first year high school students!  If I were to help a fellow educator become more confident  I would definitely share the materials given in this course. Also  I would encourage them to ask questions and not be afraid to try something new. Confidence comes from believing in what you know and believing that you're able to do this. With time  confidence builds in teaching and you can't become confident if you don't try!   This MOOC Ed definitely helped me understand more  and seeing videos of real teachers implementing what we have learned was extremely valuable.  Stephanie

From this point  i had a great time discussing with them the relationship between STATISTICS and MATHEMATICS. and i mentioned the article about the topic presented by one of our professors here in the onlne. I am pretty sure the idea is clear and that my students have unlocked their minds regarding the wrong notions.

I think if you were to teach these concepts as you go through a real-world statistical experience students would have an easier time understanding. Have students collect data around the school or even the community. Introduce them to mean  median  mode  etc. and then have them find it with their data. Then introduce them to the more advance ideas about correlation and association. I think students would be more interested and invested in their learning if they had a hands on approach with collecting the data.

I've found over the years that my students tend to have a good conceptual grasp of experimental design -- the concepts of statistical control  replication  and random assignment of subjects to treatments. When it comes to sampling  they can provide good answers to sampling questions (SRS  Stratified samples  cluster samples  etc.)  and \textbook\"" answers to why we sample. However  when it comes to their final projects  many of the students seem to want to do a census and don't really consider sampling from their population of interest. I'm hoping to find ways to get the students to better understand when to sample. One (slightly humorous) example I use is when the student goes to the doctor and needs to have some blood drawn...I tell them that they better hope the phlebotomist takes a sample and not a census of the blood. Students laugh at this  but then proceed to want to take a census because they think a census is better than a sample.  Any thoughts/suggestions are much appreciated. Thanks!  """

I like that example  thank you for sharing.    I work at a hospital and while my primary role is helping physicians  residents  and fellows design their own investigator-initiated studies and analyze the data  I am also tasked with providing a lecture series to the residents and fellows which includes introductory statistics.  I find that many of them do the same thing as your students.  Granted  often time we need to include all patients who had a specific procedure or condition due to the fact that the total number is so small.  However  there are times where the sampling frame is large enough that we do not need to include all of the patients.    Despite my lectures on sampling and power/sample size analysis they always just seem to think they need to include everyone in the sampling frame.  I would love to hear others thoughts on this topic as well.  -Hope

Nice to see you here! :)  In a way  your students are correct. You'll get better information from a census than from a sample  all else being equal. If a census is feasible  why wouldn't they do it? Maybe you could come up with a project design that requires information where a census is not feasible. I don't know what your project is like  so specifics are difficult to suggest.  Incidentally  that is one reason my projects tend to focus on experiments. Legitimate sampling procedures are difficult.  There's a cool feature on Wikipedia. There is a button to select a random article. Students could be told to select a number of articles this way and answer some question about each  then draw a conclusion. A true random sample!

Let's devise an experiment that compares 100% sampling (I guess this course calls it \census\"") to a sampling method.  I guess this easier said than done.  Maybe we could use some proportion of red and white marbles. Choose total population of 10 000 or large enough to cause counting errors. Let some group of 20 students do sample sizes of 50  100  500 and 10 000 (5 randomly selected  students would use a sample size 50 to measure the proportion and a different 5 for the 100 sample size and so on). This experiment could show how the larger sample sizes would reduce the variability in measuring the proportion and show that the 100% sampling did not give identical answers for the proportion.  Just a thought.  """

Yet  mistakes are made both in accepting tires that do not meet the specifications and rejecting tires that do meet the specifications. We also do sampling to estimate size and endurance characteristics since the tests are distructive. If the purpose is to measure certain characteristics of a  population  sampling 100% of the population will does not produce desired population characteristics free from errors as one would think.  I hope this will help in convincing people who think that 100% sampling of the population is the best method to measure desired characteristics.

It been well over 50 years since I was in high school  but an exploratory survey needs to be given to the students to determine their level understanding of graphs  statistical terms and designs of experiments. I guess it means more work for the teacher to design a survey and to understand the results of the survey.

I would like to know where i need to focus my learning.  As for my students  I think they would have some success with a few of these questions.  The textbook (CMP) I use has some similar problems  specific related to mean  median  and mode.  I think they would be able to reason through some of the questions.  I do agree that the questions were reading heavy  and this task alone can be a challenge for some students.  For students who struggle with reading  getting to the math concepts in the problem would be very difficult.  As a result  their understanding of the statistics concepts might not be able to be demonstrated.

I think the biggest issue they would have on some of the questions is discerning some of the nuances so they can decipher exactly what the question is asking. Such as when a problem said a group of 100 volunteers versus a random sample of 100.

For example  when students are asked how adding a certain amount to each value will affect the mean  I am hoping to goodness that they wouldn't add to each data entry  add them all up  and then divide (unless a teacher is making them go through all of that mess to ENCOURAGE them to find a more efficient way through understanding.)  I think that finding the mean from frequency graphs still rocks my world a little bit.  I have to slow down and really think about what the numbers in the display really represent.     Mostly working with 6th grade  I think that they need to work with numbers that they can actually represent concretely before applying to big data and messiness.  With our current standards  6th grade is when students begin to UNDERSTAND these statistical terms and displays.

Students are taught from a young age to be inclusive and think about everyone  so that is why I thought the science club question was a good one. It asked why a sample of just science club members' friends are not an inclusive survey. I think if you brainstormed first with students  to get them in the right mind set of how to represent everyone with a question  it would be easy to introduce them to harder statistics topics. I believe they could be capable of learning the hard stuff  as long as it is in a way that relates to and builds off of their elementary and every-day experience.

Recognizing most answers did not help me as much as I would have hoped. I tried to narrow it down as much as I could on some of the questions but then went on from there. Middle school students might do a pretty decent job on this assessment if they are taught the correct things. Mode  median and mean was a big topic I noticed but not with just a list of numbers. They would need to be able to analyze a graph in order to get the data to make that next step. This could be one difficult part for them.

The test reinforces that the focus of teaching statistics should be the interpretations of graphs  such as dot plots  box and whisker plots etc. When students  communicate with each other    their conceptual understanding of key statistical  concepts will improve.

Personally  there were some questions that I was able to answer rather easily and others where I did not know where to start  which essentially is a reflection of the areas that were focused on in my educational upbringing. I believe that the majority of high school students would be able to do fairly well with these questions  but would do significantly better with at least a lesson or two to retouch on all of the concepts mentioned in this investigation.

I took the high school exam and like some of you mentioned thought there was a lot of text to parse. I managed through it ok  but I think students would need to really be comfortable with statistical vocabulary in order to make sense of what the question is asking. I think learning this vocabulary should occur while doing a project like what  could be done with gapminder where the students can talk with each other about data and really engage with the data and concepts they're learning. I think this would make the  terms stick much more readily and make questions such as the ones on the quiz more approachable.

Recognizing that we could try and figure out where the middle of the data is so that we can use one number to communicate data for each population then looking for ways to determine the middle values (or most common) will make the terms median  mean  and mode have much more meaning and relevance to a student than just learning the terms and then applying the definitions.</span> """

The content of these questions is similar to the content discussed in my AP Statistics course. However  these questions did seem to focus more on conceptual understanding than many of the resources I use that prepare my students on the AP exam. The AP Statistics exam focuses more on procedural fluency than was apparent in this assessment. I am not sure how my students would do on some of the conceptual questions.     I am not sure what would be needed to help students for these conceptual questions. I imagine that data investigations would. My concern though  is time. It takes more time for investigations and to build the conceptual understanding and there isn't a lot of extra time because my school starts later than many schools.

I do not think my students would be prepared to do an investigation or ask proper questions that don't have bias. I think they would struggle with what types of investigations would be most appropriate for the information they desire to find out. To help with this  we could study different questions the students want to investigate and discuss how we should go about investigating these topics. I also think my students would struggle picking up bias amongst different graphs. For example  of the graphs in the questions started at 10 rather than 0 for the y-axis  which makes the graph misleading. I think studying different graphs that show bias would help my students better answer these questions.

Calculations of center like mean and median would come later.

This concept is well developed through investigation in our curriculum. However  I did notice that there was one issue that could prevent them from answering even the conceptual questions on this topic incorrectly. In our curriculum  at the Math 3 level  we do not use the term p-value when interpreting and drawing conclusions. The lack of using this term and concept of p-value at this level would really \""throw the students off\"" and leave them unprepared for questions like I saw on this exam. They don't get this terminology until/if they take AP Stats. </span>    Also  in my experience of teaching and coaching Math 1  2  and 3  data analysis that requires comparisons and or thinking about the effects of removing certain parts of the data and what would happen in response to it  is a struggle for most students. I feel many students would be unsuccessful with these types of questions  because of the number of teachers  I see focusing more on creation of these data representations rather than the analysis and understanding of them. Our curriculum includes investigations and applications that should help students think in this way  however  I see many teachers choosing not to use them. (Sometimes because they are intimidated by the topics themselves.)  I feel the same about other types of questions on the test. We have worked hard to create resources that help develop  the concepts  I am just unsure of how many teachers take the time to use those resources.   In order to assist in preparing students better  we would need administrative support for the county developed materials (and maybe even different  but still conceptual and investigative materials) to be used in the classroom. Many teachers are still just teaching the procedures and not focusing on the conceptual understanding. Hence  questions like these  and similar questions we give on benchmark tests continue to be missed.    """

Since the course has a heavy emphasis on hands-on experience  I wonder if its facilitators or participants have had any experience with ASA's Census At School project. If so  please comment and recommend a tech tool for grades 5 through 7. It looks like many of the questions on the middle school test are similar to what are asked in Census At School.  Thanks for any responses.

I have to make sure that they understand what is being asked of them and not assume they know.  I can see how my student would feel overwhelmed in the classroom when I am talking about certain things and they do not have any prior knowledge to help them understand what I am talking about.  I also feel that statistics is part of the normal day and when we discuss statistics with kids it shouldn't just be at Math time or announce statistics but incorporate it into the daily conversations.  I believe this would help them gain a greater understanding of statistics  how to interpret what they are seeing  how to ask the right questions and how to apply it.

Many students worry about getting the exact numbers (ie. from a census) because they think that their sample will be downgraded or useless if it is not exactly accurate. If they are taught and shown examples (like the M&amp;M example someone mentioned) where sampling may not be exact but is a great way to efficiently make an estimate  they could become more trustworthy of sampling and feel comfortable using it. In my experience  students who are afraid of their experiment/sample being \wrong\"" will always tend towards a census because they think it is what a teacher wants. Show them many occasions where sampling is the better alternative and still as accurate. """

An example might be to take a large number (several thousand actual number is unknown) of objects (M&amp;Ms  etc.). Take a random sample of 100 to 500. Weigh the sample and estimate how many are in the total population. Next  have several students independently count the total population. I expect the total population counts will not be the same.  Just a thought on how to show sampling as more efficient and just as accurate.

NCTM has two volumes in their Essential Understandings Series on teaching statistics  one for grades 6-8  and the other for 9-12 (full disclosure: I'm a co-author on the 9-12 volume). These books are for teachers  and focus on topics that are difficult to teach. Even if you teach only grades 9-12  I recommend the 6-8 volume as well. There is also a \Putting Essential Understandings into Practice\"" volume that gives concrete suggestions  examples  and activities as to how to teach certain topics (there is a grades 9-12 volume  I'm not sure about a grades 6-8 volume). This link to the education section of the ASA website can direct you to resources that might be useful: http://www.amstat.org/education/index.cfm.

I think this is a basis to which stems many generalizations that the students will need to make.

They may be able to refer back to things they have done and realize that what they are doing is close to it. One question I was unsure on was the one involving box-plot graphs.

I don't know that I personally have ever been able to avoid some form of convenience sampling when collecting data.  And even with truly random samples  it is still necessary to take into account the effects of non-responses.

You then address the class and ask if the your sample represented the entire class. Hopefully  they will respond and say it was not. Then you can apply that conclusion to the basketball scenario. All the basketball players  because of their shared characteristic  might be inclined to having a shared opinion. Of course you would need to elaborate more on the point of samples and why you use them  but maybe this would help getting the point across.

Just a general Google search? I am always looking for resources to give my Stats high schoolers. P value tripped me up  but I was able to remember what confidence interval was as I was taking the assessment.      Confidence interval is the probability/confidence that  taking samples from your population  each sample will contain the population mean. If you have a larger interval  then you have a higher confidence. The more specific your interval becomes  the less confident you become since you are narrowing it down and dropping possible values.  
33,Teaching Statistics Through Data Investigations - Spring 2016,417,Discuss With Your Colleagues,10112,p value,6633,8285,7825,25103,16/02/17 19:36:29,27943,Re: p value," In my mind  it is really important to remember that the p-value is always testing the null hypothesis (or hypothesis of no difference or no relationship).  It is a rarity for any researcher to pursue research where they are hoping to find no difference or relationship.  Instead  we always hypothesize that there will be a difference or some type of relationship.    In order to figure out if our results support or refute our hypothesis of a difference or relationship  it would be nice to know how likely it is we would have gotten these results if our hypothesis is true.  One way to do that is to set up a simulation where the populations fit our hypothesis and then run lots of samples to see how likely our results (or more extreme) would have occurred if our hypothesis was correct.  Unfortunately  we can't usually say (or want to say) say how much of a difference or strength of relationship might be there.  Setting up a simulation for a particular hypothesis we designate is really impossible.  However  we could set up a simulation where the populations are truly not different or the relationship doesn't exist - hence the null hypothesis.  Then we could run the simulation with our samples multiple times to actually determine a probability of seeing our results (or more extreme) when the population is set up to support the null hypothesis.  Since we know the population we set up was not supposed to show a difference or a relationship  any outcomes that suggest there are differences or relationships would be because of chance.  Any inferential test will always focus on determining the probability that our results (or more extreme) would have occurred if there really wasn't a difference (and would thus occur because of chance).  If you understand that the p-value is always focused on the null-hypothesis  then the value is a little easier to interpret.  For instance  a p-value of 0.3 suggests that if you were to sample a population where there really was no difference/no relationship  you would have gotten your results or something more extreme 30 times out of 100.  So it would be pretty common.  A p-value of 0.05 (typical cut-off value used in science) would suggest that 5 times our of 100 you would get your results or something more extreme in a population where there really isn't a difference.  That is much rarer.  It is even rarer to see the results (or more extreme) when p=0.01 or p=0.001.  The rarer it is that your results would have occurred if there really is no difference/no relationship  the more confident you are that your results represent a real difference or relationship.  As was stated  though  we can never say for sure that our one sample couldn't be one of the 5 out of 100 (p=0.05)  or the 1 out of 100  or the 1 out of 1000  etc.  So we can only say that the evidence supports our alternative hypothesis.  If  however  our p=value is pretty large  we can argue that our data provide evidence to refute that alternative hypothesis.  It is interesting that statistics is the primary reason we can never \prove\"" any hypothesis. """

They mention the fact that statistics is all around us and it is not an area strictly related to mathematics. Yes  mathematics can be the starting point for this  but as a future educator I think it would be a great idea to look towards other subjects and other teachers to potentially relate class topics. Therefore  students can immediately see how statistics relates to the real world and recognize that it isn't strictly about relating numbers  but also using the critical thinking and problem solving skills that you mentioned earlier. Also  by relating statistics to that of another subject you would be referring to content appropriate with that grade level  so that it challenges students without making it too difficult.

Not all topics are introduced but there are some aspects of math that tie into statistics. Showing graphs that progressively become more advanced and by collecting data that progressively includes more variables are seen throughout each grade level.  Subtly adding statistical problems at each grade level helps with critical thinking and problem solving along with preparing for more advanced statistics.

Before getting hired as a teacher I was a classroom aide and almost everything presented in this middle school test were items I saw presented to students. Where I see the difference is in identifying poor analysis and choosing the best graphing method to use to understand the data. (I don't teach math--perhaps you can tell by my inexact language here.) I'm interested in this study for the reasons I just mentioned. I want my students to be able to identify misleading information  faulty conclusions  or poor data collection  in a nutshell  to identify bias.

My high school did not even begin to prepare me for statistics and I fear not exposing my students to enough statistics.  I agree that starting kids young will help break this cycle.

More specifically  Dr. Webster's definition of what statistics is at around 4:50 on the video  that it's the science of all data. I can't think of a single social studies class that doesn't work with data and I think statistics could easily be incorporated into these classes. Even for classes like History where traditional statistics quiz questions don't necessarily mimic what is talked about  you can still utilize your students' statistical literacy by having them look at certain graphs and deducing what could've happened at some significant point in history. For example  the US' GDP during The Great Depression  students can look at a point on the graph and discuss what may have happened at that point in time based on how the GDP fluctuates. Another example is actually from this unit as well. \The Looking at Statistics with Year 8 students\"" video amazed me at how students at such a young of an age are reading data on a graph and are actively engaged and discussing their own inferences to their peers. That's the kind of activity and thinking that will get students to retain what they learn. More than that  they can build upon that knowledge later on throughout their years in school."""

However  I don't think most social studies and English teachers would feel comfortable discussing statistics with their students. Teachers tend to stick to what they feel most confident with.    This will break into another discussion  but if we expect our students to be well-rounded and to make connections between their classes; we as educators have to also be prepared to teach outside of our content area. Social studies teachers should discuss statistics just as mathematics teachers should help students with their writing and grammar.

I would prefer to see a scatterplot  raw data  and the LSRL given and asked to do some interpretation. Perhaps provide the scatterplot for another variable (such as the size of the engine) and ask if it does a better job predicting mpg  or does weight do a better job  and to justify the response. Or maybe ask which variable (weight or engine size) would the student use to predict mpg. Just a thought.

I feel they could do all of this and still be able to interpret the results from the graph which was the goal of the initial task anyway.

Two of the tasks were focused on one or two stages in the investigative process while the Coke vs. Pepsi task was the most comprehensive. It promoted statistical habits of mind through all four stages of the investigative process. One glaring problem with the Coke vs. Pepsi task was the request for participants to \refrain from looking at the front of the room\"" to avoid seeing which cola was poured into each cup. Really?  The cola needs to be poured in a different location to eliminate the possibility that participants see which cola they are tasting. """

It provided a context  allowed the students to notice the data before analyzing it. It allowed them to determine what type of graph would best display their data and allowed them to analyze to determine the answer to a real world question. The task also prepared students to be prepared for variability when they have to defend their \wait time\"" against other students. Even though the students do not get to collect the data on their own  they do get to choose their data sets.  The other two tasks (Airport Passengers and Television Time) provided little context  no collection of data  and very little analysis. Students did have to interpret the data based on questions that were posed by the teacher/curriculum. I do not see these tasks encouraging much conversation and debate among students. The Television Time question may be more motivating than the other tasks  but students could have collected the data themselves through a survey. It also would have been more beneficial to either provide a context (cable companies are inquiring) or for students to come up with their questions regarding student viewership.    """

While the students didn't actually collect the data  the task they had to complete took them through several of the habits (context of data  visual and numerical representation of the data  describing variation).  In the other two sample items  students were asked to do fewer of the habits of mind.  None of the questions took the students through all of the steps in the investigation cycle because the data was provided each time. The task about airport passengers could probably be modified by asking the question \What is the busiest airport?\""  They could then find the data  and decide how best to answer the question (number of passengers  number of airlines  number of flights  etc).

It does not always have to be a statistic that they do in their everyday life because something that is fun and unusual sometimes gets them really interested. I like to relate it back to when I did a collection data in school and I think to myself is this something I would tell a friend  parent  cousin  etc. because you find it interesting? If so then I think it would be beneficial to do. A task that I would like to do is incorporate the March Madness NCAA Tournament into a lesson and maybe do a little bracket in my room.

I don't know exactly what type of software your students have to view the data or to do statistical analysis. At the high school or middle school level  do the students know about distributions  variation  central tendency parameters ( mean  mode and median)?

I think that having students do that is a lot better than looking at data that is already made up and ready for them to analyze because students should be able to go and do something they enjoy or something that they found interesting. Maybe they could discover things that not many people realize or even think about. For example  if students were to go out and watch cars go by and see how many drivers are texting and driving in one hour  and then they come back and show you the results  I am probably very interested in what they observed or found. Or if they give out surveys of specific topics that you won't know the answer too unless you go out and do it yourself. I think that having them out in the effort too is worthwhile and it should be a fun experience or topic that they could talk about or even learn themselves. I hope this helped you answer your question.

It seemed be a very procedural process without much emphasis on what question we are trying to answer or how the data was collected. Even in the Analysis part of the cycle it didn't leave much room for students to explore with different representations of the data. To improve this task maybe students could pose some of their own questions  and either be provided with some explicit data rather than just some characteristics of a set of data or collect their own data using the internet or a survey.  Task 2: Pepsi vs Coke Activity  I enjoyed this activity the most. Students participating in this task seem like they would get to go through all of the steps of the investigative cycle. A gripe might be that the measurement or collection of the data wasn't treated as too essential as students are simply asked not to look up front as the drinks are poured. If it's impractical to pour the drinks away from the taste testers the teacher may just want to ask students what a better way might be to reinforce the measurement statistical habit.  Task 3: Television Time  I felt this task had data that was pertinent to students but  I felt the question it asked wasn't too interesting. An improvement might be to have students pose their own questions given data in that context and form. Then they could try to answer their questions or  if they determine the data set isn't appropriate  perhaps come up with a method of data collection that would work more readily.

The first task was very straight forward when it came to directions and one of the first questions that came to my mind was in regards to the purpose of the assignment itself. As you mentioned it really did not provide an initial question that allows students to know why they are working on the activity in the first place. I'm sure that all of us at one time or another can look back on some assignment that we did having asked why we were doing it or even how it relates to anything we will do in life outside of that class. I think that this could be used as a potential homework assignment after students have more of a knowledge basis on the topic  but would not use it as an introductory activity. Looking at the second task this one was also my favorite and I can see it being the most beneficial. As the expert panel mentioned  in statistics 90% of it comes during the pose and collect stage which this task includes. This task forces students to collect their own data while task 1 and task 3 simply use given data to answer questions. Altogether the tasks where students gather their own data and add their own personal touch in my opinion will have more opportunities for success.

The car one could be rewritten such that the students are given the data set (or  find a website where each group gets to pick which vehicle they want to investigate further) and then simply asking for a least-squares line  estimate/extrapolate the mpg of a certain weighted vehicle (students could pick their own weight)  to interpret the slope of the regression line in the context  and leave the last question the same. If you take out all the hints from the phrasing  it becomes more of a challenge and forces students to bounce ideas off one another and use other resources than the handout.  For the Coke vs Pepsi  the teacher could pose the question to the students the day before on what two different sodas look alike since Sprite and 7up are also similar in looks. Students could create their own experimental design and then create the data from there. It is their experience  not the teacher's. The teacher is there to guide but not to do the thinking and come up with the procedure as well.  For the third  it already asks thought-provoking questions  but it could be further extended if the students were then asked to create more informative questions for the data set. Or  to survey their friends and come back and apply the same questions to their data.

They come up with things that you wouldn't see in a more teacher driven project.

One thing I can think of to get students out of their comfort zones is to describe the project before it's actually assigned so that they have extra time to think about what they can research about. More than that though  it would be beneficial to have dedicated lab days where the students are either: a) working on their project  or b) looking for an idea to research and analyze. The thing that'll make it different  however  is if you add the caveat that their idea requires an \Ok\"" from you as a teacher. This way  if you deem that their idea is too safe/easy  you'll have a basis for what each specific student is interested in and you can help elaborate on what they can research instead. You'll be able to facilitate a better learning experience and make sure that what each student is researching is based on something they're interested in so that it's more engaging for them and more productive for everybody involved."""

This is exactly the kind of task that Dr. Susan Friel was  describing when she said ‚ÄúWhat you see in textbooks and what you do often is in  the analyze phase.‚Äù The students did not pose a question  collect or even see  the collection of data. They are simply given the means and standard  deviations.

Again  ideally  it would be  something like TUVA where there are a variety of variables that describe cars.  Students would then be asked to look for variables that have a strong  correlation. When a few variable pairs have been identified  then students  would be asked which of the data pairs did they find most interesting. Ideally   it would be the weight vs MPG. In which case the students would calculate   using technology  the means  standard deviations and correlation for these two  variables and fine their Lease Squares Regression Line. The class could then  make their own predictions about cars with specific weights or MPG  talk about  the meaning of the slops and the meaning of the coefficient of determination. This  would be the ideal setting for an investigation on weight vs MPG. However a  different data set or a different data pair from a data set about cars could be  used and the same statistical tasks could be practiced.     <p style=\""margin-left:.25in\"">A task as described previously  would be more worthwhile because students will have developed the question  themselves  therefore it will be more meaningful to them. They will interact  with data that is close to how it is used outside of education.

The students were involved in  the collecting of data and the interpretation of data. The students would know  where the data came from and how it was collected because they collected it.  The students were also asked to make inferences about the data using a  confidence interval and hypothesis test. However  the context of the study was  not a random sample from a larger population. If they want to know the  proportion of students who prefer Pepsi over Coke in their class  they can now  calculate it. They actually performed a census and a confidence interval and  hypothesis test are meaningless.     <p style=\""margin-left:.25in\"">Also I felt that this task was a  little weak on the analyze phase. I wish that the students created graphs from  their data  asked multiple questions from the data before they immediately  looked at the confidence interval and hypothesis test.

This task did a very good job of having students  collect their own data. They would have to collect and manage the data. They  were involved with blinding and either explicit or implicit understand the  importance of blinding in this experiment. On the other hand the task did not  ask students to pose the question themselves  analyze the data in an authentic  way or interpret meaningful results.     <p style=\""margin-left:.25in;  text-indent:-.25in\""><!--[if !supportLists]-->4.<span style=\""font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;\"">        </span><!--[endif]-->What would you change about this task to make it  more worthwhile? why?      This task could have been started at the end of the previous  class period where students are asked to construct a blinded taste test experiment  between two foods. This would be done in pairs or small groups. The students  should be aware that blinding is not only that the participant does not know  which food is which  but it must be unclear to the participant. For example  comparing oatmeal cookies and M&amp;M cookies wouldn‚Äôt be truly blind because  the participant would taste the M&amp;Ms. Then the teacher would ask the groups  to present their blinded taste test experiment. The class would discuss the  effectiveness of those experiments. After all groups had presented there would  be a discussion about which experiment are the students interested in  participating in.              <h4><b>Task 3.

There were even problems with how  the data was collected. There is interviewer bias because when a teacher asks a  student how much television they watched  the student might report a smaller  number than they actually do. The task would require the students to analyze by  drawing two new graphs  because the representation provided is hard to see the  distribution of Ms. Lee‚Äôs students. Also  the students can‚Äôt interpret the  results because there was no question posed and no larger population in mind.     <p style=\""margin-left:.25in\"">On the other hand the discussion  of which group of students watched more television could promote a productive  discussion. There is enough variability in the data that it may not be clear  which class watched more TV. The students could discuss mean  median and mode  in their discussion. If the teacher encourages the students to find the means  and compares them  then a teaching moment would have been lost.     <p style=\""margin-left:.25in;  text-indent:-.25in\""><!--[if !supportLists]-->3.<span style=\""font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;\"">        </span><!--[endif]-->Could this task promote productive statistical  habits of mind?     <p style=\""margin-left:.25in\"">This task could promote the importance of good visuals because the one  provided was not very good.

I would maybe try to expand upon this and do other activities as well  such as time spent doing sports  or reading  or anything else that might happen outside of school. That will give them more statistics to analyze and then they could even try to make comparisons and connections between these data collections

The one I liked the most was the TV one because it relates to the students interests. They all watch TV everyday  whereas they might not fly or never have flown  or have less interest in eruptions of geysers. I wish this task went more into depth like the Old Faithful task did because it allows the students to investigate more with statistics. These tasks  especially the tv one are relatable to student's everyday lives which then in return allows them to see where statistics falls into their everyday lives.

If you have not already seen the Written Statistics Task Guide in Unit 2  I encourage you to consider this and think about how each of these tasks promotes opportunities for developing statistical habits of mind and engages students in the four phases of a statistical investigation. See the Essentials Page <a href=\https://place.fi.ncsu.edu/mod/resourcelib/view.php?id=2164\"" target=\""_blank\"">here</a>.

I think that these three tasks provided some ideas for teachers in how to offer their students opportunities to engage in statistical thinking. The context is good  even when students may/may not be overly interested in what they are working with at that moment.  However  I think that the way these tasks are all written  it takes away some phases of the \investigative cycle\"" as has been explained in detail through Unit 2 thus far.   <strong>Are the students really encouraged to...</strong>  1. Pose a Question?  2. Collect Data that will be needed to answer this question?  I was reminded of what Dr. Susan Friel mentioned in the expert panel audio whenever she brought attention to how textbooks usually offer material that takes all of us (students  in particular) straight to phase 3 (Analyze) of the investigative cycle. We  as teachers  should certainly encourage conversation with students about the first two phases as precursors to the tasks in order to give meaning/purpose to analyzing and interpreting so that the investigative cycle is complete.

This task promotes statistical habits because students are breaking down the data on the graph and connecting it between two classes. If i was teaching  I would have the students take a survey to see how much TV they watch and then we could develop a graph from there. Then the students could draw certain portions of information about their two separate classes.

I think that this promotes many statistical habits of mind  including being able to analyze and relate  as well as compare and contrast many data sets for the same scenario through collaboration. I think this problem does a really good job of taking students through the process of the investigation cycle  and asking valid questions to engage students and make them think deeper about the statistical data before them. The only aspect of this problem I would change is allowing the students to gather their own data. For this specific scenario  this may not be possible  however  for other problems I think it is very beneficial for students to gather their own data on a topic in order to fully understand the statistical process as well as developing those statistical habits of mind.

This likely is online...maybe from Wolfram Alpha???  This might be a good introduction  and THEN they could look up the BIG data online.  I also thought it was odd that they only looked at 16 days.  How were these days determined?  How was this data collected?  I would imagine water levels  etc. would affect the timing???  Another plus of this lesson was that it asked students to look at their 2 days and record \notices\"" and \""wonders\"" before digging into the analyze phase. """

Part of what makes it so engaging is that it asks a relevant question  a fundamental part of the statistical cycle.  We see all four stages of this cycle in the task (pose question  collect data  analyze data  and interpret data).

I wouldn't teach this task as is. I feel it is too short and doesn't allow for a lot of exploration by the students. I like the idea of students studying correlations between topics such as amount of TV watched vs grades. You could even go in more depth and collect data on what they are watching. Are students who are watching more engaging programs doing better in school? There might be no correlation at all  but that could be something to look into.

Then analyze the data to see if there is a pattern between freshman Algebra students and junior Algebra 2 students. Another investigation might be to compare students earning A's or B's TV time with students earning C's or D's TV time.

Students know why they're doing the investigation. To improve the other two activities  I would try to make the question that needs to be asked clearer and more compelling to students - something they might get excited about and be curious about the outcome.

The Coke vs Pepsi activity was the most interactive and allowed students to feel a connection to the lesson.  Although  I think if I were to do something similar  I would have to come up with a different beverage choice - most of my students today seem very health conscious and don't drink sugary drinks.  The TV Time investigation could be good if the students first made some hypothesis about their thoughts with amount of TV Time compared to a variety of activities - sleep  sports  studying  grades.  After the preliminary task of determining how much TV time  they could test what would happen with more or less TV time.     The MPG activity could get high school students that are learning to drive a little excited with thought of maybe buying their first cars.

The TV Time Task could be used to help students see how different variables can be affected  such as sleep  grades  or sports.  I would do this in two steps.  First I would let the class take a guess as to the average amount of time spent watching TV.  Then we would collect the date to see who was closest.  Then we could compare this to other variables and create an experiment to see if changing TV Time would result in a change in the chosen variable.  THe MPG Task could introduce high school drivers  especially those that may be wanting to buy a car.

Do you think students actually realize how much time they spend per day watching TV  or would you have them keep a log for a few/several days to find out?

The students are physically involved in the experiment in more ways than they would be if we just give them data. However  with class sizes usually around 30 students  the standard error and margin for error will be very large. For instance  if 13 out of 30 prefer Coke (p-hat = .433)  the 95% CI is (.256  .611)  not very useful information.

I like that the activity had students ask their own questions  although all questions that students might \wonder\"" might not require the use of data to answer.  The overall question that is posed  however  is how long will visitors have to wait until Old Faithful erupts again.  A table of measured wait time for 16 days is given and students are encouraged to \""randomly\"" pick two rows to analyze.  This would be a good point in the investigation to discuss with students (if it hasn't already been done) methods of random sampling.  Students are then told to analyze the data by creating a graph to represent the given information.  There is a lot of room left here for interpretation.  I would be interested to see how well this works at a middle school level.  The last step involved discussions and presentations to answer the posed questions.  It sounds like a great activity!  I'm not sure how interested my students might be in Old Faithful  but I might consider following the same model with something more \""trendy.\"" """

As well  you could look at students who participate in after school activities and those who do not.  Or you could do after school activities 4-5 times a week vs. 1-2 times a week.  Students then can see how activities and being active lead to different outcomes.  It would be an interesting study or question  does after school activities lead to less time in front of the TV.    Another sample could be students who go to a day care or after school program vs. those who go home right away after school.

This would allow for more freedom and ownership of the material.  They then could compare the two sets of data to determine how they relate. Using this information  they could draw conclusions about the students and their television watching habits. This could be extended to have students derive a purpose for this data collection. Who could use it? Why would it be beneficial?

It solely has the students investigating data already decided upon. I could easily have my students track their own gas mileage and catalog it on a spreadsheet that could be analyzed on several levels; overall  cars  trucks  suvs  etc. The students would then have to pose the question  collect the data  analyze it and form conclusions; partake in the whole investigative cycle.

There is enough variability in the two distributions that it would not be clear which group watched more television. Do you decide this based on the mean  median or mode?

This looks like a really good resource and seems very pertinent to this Mooc. I  only skimmed through it quickly but the recommendations in Chapter 2 caught my eye. Looking at those it seems like a key problem with statistics education in schools might be that the teacher's themselves haven't had a thorough course on what precisely statistics is and what it isn't. It seems like many teachers focus on algorithms and definitions in isolation as opposed to the whole process of posing questions  collecting data  analyzing it  and interpreting the results. I know back in High School my teacher focused mostly on probability and glossed over much of the statistical investigative cycle.

I find that with my middle school students the visualization aspect of a concept is most important in getting them to understand a concept.  I wish I had know about the TUVA website during my statistics unit that I taught earlier in the year.  I plan on using it when I teach the unit next year.  I am thinking about using one or both of the websites when I teach about linear relationships later in the year.  I liked how you could easily manipulate the variables and get a graph.  While making graphs is important  sometimes you want to focus on the analysis or interpretation of the graphs  and these sites would make that very easy.  I also liked how you could switched between different graph types. I think it helps illustrate when which types of graphs should be used.  The dot plots used on the TUVA website are similar to ones used in my textbook (CMP 2)  so it's a nice connect for my students.

Another reason why they are so great is because they can help minimize mess  cost (there are multiple free versions of any kind of manipulative online)  and they do a great job with helping students understand what they are doing. I do not think that going away from pencil and paper is a good solution though. They need the hands on experience where they need to set up a graph and plot the data by hand so they realize how to do it without the assistance of a computer. They will have to do many things like labeling the x and y axis  creating the range of numbers suitable for the graph  a title  and many other ideas that will help them understand graphing more.

I totally agree with everyone that we need the paper and pencil activities of actually constructing these graphs and plots. But we also need the virtual manipulatives so that are students have access to the variation in statistics. We can only create so many dot plots in a class period and with limited number of dots. But virtual statistical models allow us to run sampling distributions with various sample sizes over and over again so that we can visually see the variations and the changes that occur with sample size.

I think that if we give students technology first that they will rely too much on using technology and will not want to go back to learning to solve equations by hand. I am the type of person who likes to know the reason for completing a problem. For instance  if I am solving an equation or graphing an equation I like to know why I am doing it  and I feel that doing the equation by hand is a great way to understand why we are solving the equation. Often  technology will give us the answer  but not make us go through the process that it takes to get the answer.

I think the manipulatives should be used to enhance the experience  not replace it.

When students are first being introduced to statistics and are trying see the relationships between variables  it is much better to use the virtual tools so they can see what is going on.  They can use these tools to decide which specific variables to focus on and then can switch to pencil and paper to continue analyzing the specific data they have selected.

I really liked working with this interactive technology and I could see how it could be integrated into lessons.  I think students would enjoy this hands-on technology and benefit from using it.  There is so much interactive technology that can be used to help enhance student learning.  However  I feel like we are unaware that this type of technology is available or that we are unsure about how to incorporate it into our lessons.  How do we gain awareness of interactive technology so we can incorporate it into our classrooms?

Personally  I think one of the best ways to gain awareness about say interactive technology is to lean on other educators that have been teaching the subject for awhile. Communicating with fellow educators is always a great way to learn about new opportunities because they will have different experience than you and they will most likely have different viewpoints that will open your eyes to new tasks or ways to set up a lesson. Also  part of that can simply come from researching on your own as well. Use the websites that you already know and simply explore to find out all that they offer.

I think that letting your students know that technology will be used in every class in their future  just like we are doing now and let them know that every bit of learning about technology will help them succeed more easily than those who don't know anything about technology. I barely took technology classes and I still have no clue what I am doing sometimes  but the thrill of it is that you can explore different areas of learning and you can also have fun learning games for your students to do. I heard just the other day that now instead of young students going outside for recess  that some students are told to stay inside and play on tablets and other websites. I assume that teachers now  are starting to get their students ready for the future when they will have to know what they are doing more than their parents even. Since the brain of a young child is still developing  it is easier for them to learn something new than it is for some of us and other adults now. try to incorporate math into your tablets  or computer  or what the devices maybe for your students to get them to understand that they will be glad that they learned about it at that time.

I think as education students we should dedicate a portion of our free time seeking out information about that or at least be on the lookout for new technologies that we can incorporate into our classrooms. Things like workshops in our university  education conferences  or even just talking to your professors would really help. Spreading awareness is all collaboration among participants so asking around  participating in seminars  or participating in MOOCs like this will naturally increase your awareness because with everyone sharing their own personal experiences  you're bound to find someone with valuable feedback you can use and you can  likewise  do the same for others.

To integrate technology (and more to incite more curiosity about what technology's role in math and data is)  you could create your own QR codes that link to a certain website with data (which might lead to having groups of students with one smartphone each and have them do a scavenger hunt to mess around with the sites and data)  make posters of simply links to places. If students want to know why on Earth you put it up there  tell them to go to the link and play around. It could be an end of class extra activity if needed. Or  pose questions students have to answer through a youtube video (put this link up around the room)  and students answer the questions posed in the video by going to various sites (links in video description) and responding in the comments. A semester/unit requirement could be for students to visit each site and answer at least one question per video by the end of the semester/unit. That way  it is more of an individual pace as well as learning how to interact with the computer and other data sites.

Statistics is its own language entirely. Like a foreign language  many math teachers stray away from it due to a lack of comfort in the material. With new content comes an eagerness to learn. We need to as educators be as willing to learn something as we want our students to be. We need to break out of our comfort zones and experience statistics. I think this class is helping create a deeper understanding of some misconceptions about statistics and I look forward to gaining more information.

Statistics can determine if your ideas are headed in the right direction. It can demonstrate how variation can cloud what your are trying to prove. It can remove a lot of the personal bias in a study. I am working on a simple study to measure the cost effectiveness of buying apples at a price per pound versus given number of apples at a specific price. I guess the good thing about the study is the students can eat what they have measured.     We have to be careful not to overwhelm the students with equations.

There are outer limits to the field which are yet to be learned/discovered.  <p style=\""box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 11px; color: rgb(51  51  51); font-family: UniversRoman  Arial  sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 22.4px; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255  255  255);\"">The way we teach science to children is generally not scientific. We teach them what was already discovered through science or set them up to draw a predetermined conclusion. It is important to have background information in a field of study  if someone hopes to extend that field. The math that is taught to the majority of our population  including most scientists and undergraduate math majors  is foundational. That does not mean the entire field is static.   <p style=\""box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 11px; color: rgb(51  51  51); font-family: UniversRoman  Arial  sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 22.4px; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255  255  255);\"">I think what sets math apart from the other disciplines is that everything must be proven using watertight logic and procedures. When a conclusion is finally reached  it is arrived at with certainty. In the traditional sciences (I'll include stats in that group) conclusions must be drawn under conditions of uncertainty. The best we can do is to accurately assess the likelihood of our conclusions and report them in a responsible way. This is why I think it is important to teach statistics. Too many uncertain conclusions are presented and taken as certainty. Math is useful and beautiful  but our world does not often present real life certainty.    """

I am teaching a one-semester course to seniors this spring.  And I am considering using the ASA project competition as the driving reason to learn the Stats.  Has anyone ever participated in this contest before?  Or used this approach?   I figure this will help me and them organize the learning  as we will have to go through the 4 phases of the stats cycle.  I hope they will find it engaging as they will be investigating a question of their choosing for the competition.  I would appreciate any help  pointers  comments  ... from this learning/teaching community.  Thanks for helping me think this through.

For so long  I have dreaded teaching statistics to my Algebra 2 level students because I never feel I am teaching them any real understanding  mostly because of time constraints with the curriculum.

For example  used to do a pie graph lesson where I would have students make a list of 6-8 activities they typically do in a day  with the corresponding  hours for each. The hours had to add up to 24 hours. Then I would have them create a pie chart from it. It did not occur to me to also have them do a bard chart  and compare the merits of the two representations. The panel discussion prompted me to go online and investigate why pie charts are less valuable due to the viewer needing to coordinate angle and area in their interpretation of the chart.

The high school students at the end  like you said  used a small sample size and never thought critically about how that could easily have been a misrepresentation of the actual data.

Personally  what stood out for me that illustrated the differences was the students' understanding and application of the sample size. We could see that the one group of girls initially started with only 6 rolls of the dice before increasing that to 36 rolls. As we could see when their results were compared with the second group of girls  their sample size was much too small and they were not aware of that concept. Also  the second group of girls as well as the first group of guys were farther ahead in the aspect that they observed the overall pattern with the dice and the fact that they were not \fair\"".  That is also a very good point about this simulation representing only the analysis and interpretation SASI. This was not something that I originally thought of  but completely agree with the thoughts that it is mainly focused on these two levels. I do think it could potentially be part of the collect SASI  as well simply because the students have the ability to change the number of rolls (sample size). """

I think that this a totally okay though  as long as the teacher provides the students with reasoning about why the question is important and useful in society. The teacher could ask the class \There is a new game called Schoolopoly that uses dice..(maybe explain a little further)...what do you think is important for making this game fair?\"" Then the students could discuss what makes the game fair. If a student suggests the dice  then use that to lead into the lesson. Otherwise suggest that as a teacher and ask the students if they agree before continuing.

They made conjectures  tested their conjectures with a relatively small sample  decided they needed more evidence and even added a different graph until they were convinced that the die were not fair.  They were forming statistical habits of mind by experimenting personally with the data and discussing it with a partner.  This video was a powerful demonstration of how students intuitively can come up with statistical ideas and habits of mind.  In the second video we saw three levels of the SASI model.  We saw level A.  The first group was simply trying to interpret the data at Level A on the SASI model. Where as group 2 performed more trials and were interpreting at a deeper level B.  There was more discussion and thought with this group.  The third group performed at level C.  The compared what they saw to what they should have seen if the die was fair.  They were using comparison to a known distribution to make their conclusions.

They were able to make claims and then see if  the data backed up their claims.

I think the tools were important in helping these students with their understanding.  When they had a disagreement  they could easily run another set of data (sometimes with a greater sample size) to test their ideas.  It didn't take very long to do this with the simulations.  If they had to do it by rolling the dice  it would have been very time consuming.  I also liked how they could see the data in a variety of forms.  Some people like numbers better while others like graphical representations.  These programs allow the data to be displayed in a variety of forms  and I think this helps students with different learning styles to develop their understanding.

First group: level A all the way.  I would put the second group at level C for collection but B for analysis.  And the third group at level B for collection because their sample size was small  despite their level of sophistication at analysis (using the chi-squared test).

I think that the simulations that were used in the videos were key to the deeper meaning and understanding of the topic. Sample size was a problem for the two middle schoolers until they decided to go larger than 60 and 300. Without going further they may have made the assumption that it was an even probability.

With software providing thousands of trials in moments  it takes a negligible investment to gather thousands of trials. Of course  do the trials.

At first both students believed that their company might be fair but decided to try greater numbers to be sure. This led to doubt which led them to try even more trials. With the collaboration between the two they eventually decided that the dice were not fair. Without the application this would have been more difficult to achieve. The tool allowed them to model great amounts of die throws an helped them develop skepticism about a small sample size and the importance of sample size.  I'm struggling a bit to determine what level the various groups of students are at in the SASI framework. Since the experiment was done using a simulation and the questions were given to them it seems like students wouldn't have as much opportunity for the pose and collect part of the statistical cycle.  For the high school students it seemed like they got fixated on the chi squared test and didn't think to increase the sample size because of that.

The technology allowed them to test out and visualize what they were thinking was going to happen. Essentially it was testing their hypotheses that they were talking about to their group members. It also allowed them to do large scale tests in short periods of time.  I don't think many 11-12 year olds would enjoy rolling a dice 1000 times for example. They would become sidetracked and bored with the assignment so using technology sped up the process and gave them a visual bar graph that helped them analyze the data easier.

If the problem had used physical dice  like you said  the task wouldn't be as interesting for students. The task also wouldn't be realistic  plus there is more chance for error. The computer model still allowed students to choose their sample size and this way the size could be much bigger than what students would realistically be able to physically do. The application also gave a running bar graph so students could graphically see what the results are. This graph is also more useful then a graph that students could have made themselves because there could be some error in students data transfer. This is a good example of how technology can really advance a problem in mathematics and statistics.

Through being able to immediately see the results of their hypothesis  students can continue to further their ideas in more \spur of the moment\"" situations. For instance  if students had to physically roll the dice while gathering data  it would be very easy for them to become distracted or potentially forget their original train of thought therefore causing more or less a mental block on their ideas. Altogether these technology tools do a great job of encouraging communication between partners or groups and cause students to bounce ideas off of each other as well.  Looking particularly at the SASI framework  we would categorize the first group of girls at more of a Level A because they do not take into account their sample size and don't really try more than one trial. Likewise  the second group of girls would definitely be closer to Level C because they take into account the importance of sample size and also recognize the common pattern among the dice rolled.

By using technology  students can be more engaged and collect a great amount of data in a shorter time frame.  This also leaves more time for students to be able to think about the data. """

Having the technology tools make it really easy to simulate what they are trying to do as opposed to manually rolling the dice.

All they are really concerned about is finding the most fair set of dice so having the technology do the rolling and recording for them makes the process go more smoothly.

In the videos  the students used smaller amounts of trials. Two groups realized that by increasing the size of the trials  more valuable results would form. This provides more concrete evidence to support your hypothesis. For the group that did not grasp that initially  they are in the early statistics mindset. For the AP group  they are thinking beyond the first two groups. Simulations allow for a variety of statistics levels to gain and develop skills in stats courses. They can be valuable for all levels to further their understanding and support their hypotheses.

I find that asking them to build on their knowledge of simulation through these phases allows for the students to understand the methodology behind the computer simulations and therefore the conclusions are communicated better.

Figuring out their interests  then creating lessons they can use towards those interests would be great. Earlier someone posted that they had a teacher have the class look for statistical examples in political ads. I would have liked this project in high school because students are getting close to the voting age  and this is an election year. Doing activities like that remind students that statistics can be totally relevant to them.

Anyway that we can help students in areas outside of the classroom through the activities that we do are extremely beneficial.

I often feel that I get a lot more out of a project than a test/quiz. It forces students to apply their knowledge  often in a real world setting.

In my opinion  tests can give students much anxiety and not allow them to fully show their potential and understanding of topics. By assigning a project  although they have a due date  they are not as pressed for time  are allowed to express more creativity  and can truly demonstrate their understanding and application of statistics.

I also think its a let less \high stakes\"" than a test. This will give the students time to rework their project correcting any simple errors that might have gone unnoticed on a test  costing them points.

Sometimes I think that students just memorize the material that will be on the quiz/test and forget it later on.

Also  if you have students work on the project in class you can observe their misconceptions or knowledge about the topic.

The second one I based off the task where dice were used to introduce sampling distributions and instead of dice rolls used the skittle bags and the proportion of a particular color.  The third task was based off the Pepsi and Coke taste test with it expanded more to give students explicit exposure to the SASI framework.  I attached the three tasks below  the analysis for each is included with the document.  I appreciate any feedback!  """

I've actually done the skittle one and it was one of my favorite tasks to do statistics with. It is very hands on and kids love it because it deals with food! The pepsi and coke adaptation is also very interesting. Anything could be put in place with this because there is always brand name and generic things for just about everything. I've done a task similar to this in one of my high school classes and it was a ton of fun! Lastly  the statistics investigation with cencus at school data gets students to really use the four steps of statistics which is really cool. You did a great job!

I also wanted to practice reviewing different tasks with the SASI framework model. I found three great tasks for 3-5 graders on the NCTM Illuminations website. I adapted each of them a little bit. The first activity was the students calculating their heartbeat when in place  jogging  going up and down stairs  etc. They had to create graphs and analyze their data. I thought this was a fun one because it was very hands on and got the kids up and moving.   The second task had to do with how many breaths we take in a day. They were to make guesses and report the guesses on a graph of their choice and analyze that data. Then they were to figure out a way to calculate how many breaths they take in an hour and how many they take in a day. They obviously can't count how many breaths for that long so they have to find a way to figure that out. For example  they could count how many breaths it takes for one minute and multiply that number by 60 to get how many breaths in one hour. They have to figure out if this would be accurate though and why.   The third task had to deal with how many gallons of water we use a day and could we survive if we had the limited amount of water people only get to use on a spaceship. This starts off with the students thinking about how much they use water a day. THey brain storm all of their activities and guess how much actual water they use a day. Then they try and figure out how much one gallon of water weighs (the astronauts on get 6 gallons of water a day to use for everything they use). The students make predictions  and figure out how much a pint weighs and a gallon. The students create their own grapsh to represent their predictions and actual results. After doing this the students are asked to find the mean  median  and mode and which is the most useful in this activity. The task has the students figure out ways they can reduce their water usage and create new containers for the water to fit in rather than in plain milk jugs.      I think all of these tasks were worthwhile as they were hands on and seemed engaging to students. It brought mathematics into the real world which needs to be done more. All of these when looking at the SASI framework model fell in the Level B/C categories for each step.

This seems like a good way to introduce the four phases of the investigative cycle. I would just really make sure to make it very clear what phase the students are currently in. For example  just making sure when students are playing the game and recording if a stronger deck wins or loses that they understand they are in the collecting data portion of the cycle. Also defining exactly what \""stronger\"" means for a deck  either the students could decide or maybe the teacher. I believe in the article that you cited it was the number of kings in a deck that made it the stronger deck.  Then one thing I might say for context is just to make sure students understand that the games they are playing make up a relatively small sample. I believe the article they ran 1000 simulations. It could be important here just because with the stronger deck there was higher probability of winning but the article mentions how even with 1000 trials they ended up with pretty large margins of error. Thus it could be difficult to ask students to interpret from a small sample. It would make for an excellent discussion though.  Very cool and interesting activity!  """

It is a game that your student are probably going to know how to play already  which should help you when explaining. Also it can really get your students up and going and you will see the competitiveness really kick in with your students. I also like the discussion part you have with it as well because in reality who really knows which deck of cards is going to be the best to pick from  so this makes a great topic for discussion and it would be interesting to see what all of your students say. Overall I would have to say you did a great job with your project here. The only way I can see for adjustments though would be after you do your activities the first time because you really don't know how things are going to work out until you actually try them yourself.

I think when planning my own lessons  I will not be giving hints about strange data since they will question it naturally. It is interesting to see that students are natural skeptics. I would like to see students move from thinking about this sample (North Carolina) into a more broad discussion.  I believe that would be generalizing from the sample to the population in the SASI framework. Would the transportation options change in an urban environment versus a suburban environment? What about the travel times in different environments? I think it would be interesting having students consider time period as well. What types of transportation would stay the same and what would differ in the 1900s versus the 2000s? One of the strategies I would use  is having students work in groups to complete assignments. I would assign them different roles based on their ability. Some students may be the questioners or the posers  some would be the data collectors  some would be the interpreters  and others would be the analyzers. There roles would change throughout the unit so that each student would have an opportunity to be an expert in each phase of the SASI framework. This would be done at the middle school level. """

I agree that by the students answering the question of travel times in various environments would allow them to also so that there can be factors that affect travel and in turn affect the data they collected which may not necessarily be an outlier but as a result of the factor. I love the idea of having the students carry out different part of the investigation process and then rotating the roles so that the students can master each phase of statistical investigation.

As evident in the videos  statical habits of mind evolve naturally from a problem when students have hands on experiences with the data in a context that they can relate to. Students used visual displays of data and considered the context to continually revise their statistical question of interest.  They connected the numerical and visual displays to revise and reconsider the question and the evidence they would use to justify their conclusion when answering the question.  More importantly  they weighed the likelihood of some of the extreme data points and used logic to clean up the data.   This demonstrates the power of manipulating real life data in the classroom to teach statistics and how effective and useful it can be.

They were skeptical and wondered if they would see the same results if they did another random sample of 500.  This is a trait that must be taught to students since so many see their initial conclusion as the ending point of their analysis when in reality there is still more to be considered.   I think my students at first would have trouble coming up with the questions.  In their mathematical careers  questions were always given to them.  In their statistical courses I think they will struggle at the beginning asking good questions.    I think when students are first starting in a statistics course it would be important to come back together as a group after each stage of the cycle to see what students have produced and as a class determine where improvements could be made.

In general  the goal is to get done  so if they reach a natural endpoint they will seize the opportunity to move on.

If you were doing an activity where students investigate and analyze a set of data (like the transportation data set in the video)  a teacher could ask a question like  \""what question could you investigate now?\"" after the students have completed the assignment.

While many older students  are inherently skeptical  questioning strategies may have to be utilized with  younger students to push them into not accepting every data value as  legitimate.       The model students in the video used a cycle of posing a  question  revisiting and re-visualizing the data  and then refining their  question to get at a more answerable question.    That kind of critical evaluation and revision would be difficult for  many students. A strategy of modeling this cyclic thinking with several  questions as a whole class may be used to push students into deeper  investigations in their group or personal stats activities.

Use those for an example if you want to. Or  maybe the questions of measuring with and without the shoe on.  If you model getting the data and then ask the class  what do you want to discover using this data  they should give you some straightforward questions. Then  all you have to do is define what they mean. For the transportation problem  WHY did they care more about the type over the amount of time? If you were a student in NC  would you care how you got to school or how long you were bored on the way there when you could use that time to sleep in? Knowing why they cared for that type more than another  puts the question and data into a relatable context and can transform that simple question into a deeper one with results. """

However you view learning styles  whether it is Gardner's Multiple Intelligences or traits picked up over may years of teaching  I think that it is one of the most important aspects of teaching your students. So many say that they do not like a subject and then another year they might love it. It all depends how you can bring that information to them and have it connect to them. Will you get every last student to love your class? Most likely not. But you can make sure that every student has the best chance to learn and get the most out of what you are teaching. I think that using technology is just one access key to hitting a lot of these requirements.

I agree that it would probably be a good idea to discuss how to collect data correctly. It probably does not even have to be a full lecture or anything  but by causing the students to think about where error may be present while collecting data can significantly impact the way they go about this process. When we begin to question where the data comes from and the possible error associated with it  it only makes the results become that much more accurate.

In the videos we saw how the students were constantly changing the questions they were asking based on certain aspects.

I am not saying that they shouldn't adjust the questions as they proceed  but it appears as if the whole process would be much easier if the students created stronger questions from the start.

Them collecting data would be easy within just that one classroom  but to get a whole school  or even schools statewide for example  would be very difficult. Also  with that being said  since we are talking about kids here  I feel like some data would be skewed. Just like the boat traveling 3 hours to school in the video. Some kids just wouldn't take it serious and fill out silly answers. Students also might struggle with inferring how data from a small town could vary from a data from bigger towns. For example  where i grew up  the vast majority of people in high school were taking a car to school  where in large cities such as Milwaukee  i wouldn't expect the same.

One of the students did say that they did a sample for NC but still really aren't sure whose data they have.  Developing intuitive critical thinking and skepticism takes time.  Also  having tools such as Census at School enables students to quickly take several random samples and see how the samples compare  and statistics software enables them to look at the data more quickly and find the big picture based on the data collected.

In the video I saw this when somebody mentioned how they thought most people walk to school because that is what they did when they were younger. Getting students to recognize this would be getting them to recognize that their background and others differ. Thus when forming questions they should keep that in mind. A strategy to get students to recognize this would be just like they had in the video where students were working in groups. This way multiple perspectives and a back and forth can happen as they decide on some questions they may want answered.  When interpreting results they can then strategically use their background and their groupmates' backgrounds to consider the validity of outliers and overall results.

Student's should be able to recognize that they walked to school in a short amount of time  but the question they are investigating is asking if that is most common or not. Maybe a good way to help students recognize that not everyone is like them is to just take a small class sample before starting an investigation. You could present the question  sample your class to show the differences  and then find more data to see what the real results are. This could create a good habit of students wondering about others before they make assumptions.

If they had to do another random sample of 500 students by hand  they likely would have chosen not to do so.  One challenge that I have had personally is being able to upload data into statistical software.    I can explore my heart out with the data sets already uploaded into TUVA  etc.  but when I tried to upload into my TInspire software  I was totally lost.  I think that students need work with some clean data sets to get used to software  but I would hope that I could guide them in using tools flexibly OUTSIDE of the classroom as well.  Right now  I am not purchasing any new software and am confused about what would be the most friendly for middle school.  I loved seeing the students be able to manipulate the data sets in Tinkerplots from the video  but I think that I need more support in doing this personally before I would engage students in big  messy data.

I think some form of personal or group training in how to use these tools would be really beneficial if a school should implement them in the curriculum.   The extra time that the students had was my biggest \aha\"" moment too. That extra time enabled them to have more time to think about the data itself and figure out what is relevant and what isn't and if they didn't have that option  I doubt that they would've had an accurate conclusion considering that their time spent was used on refining their data.

I have helped teachers with projects in which they wanted their students to create surveys to gather data from the student body. The students frequently do not have a clear question in mind. They do not know what they want to investigate  or they do not know how to phrase the question or select the correct question type to get useful data.  I find myself spending a good deal of time questioning students about their objective to help them refine their question.

We also did projects such as counting the number of each colored m&amp;m in a large bag of m&amp;m's  and analyzing that data. This made it a lot easier to understand more difficult subjects since it was hands on and we were doing the work.

For the same reason they don't know how to collect the data and that I believe is as a result of what teachers have grown accustom to in the past. We as educators have to ensure that we allow and aid students in the right way to complete all four phases of statistical investigation instead of doing what we are accustom to and just give them the data and then have them analyze the data. Over time the process would be easy and even if the question they initially pose is not appropriate from the beginning the students should be able to know that if the question is restructured and the data is cleaned up a bit then the information that is most reflective of the samples.

Giving opportunities for students to identify potential problems with weak questions can help students construct their own criteria for posing productive questions about data.    As a teacher I have found it very helpful to try to anticipate how students will react to potential questions  then develop sets of prompts and questions that I might use to move students further along in building their understanding.

Most elementary schools include the basic mean  median  etc.  and the basic graphs.  If you can expand on those topics to interpret the information or ask different questions about the information that prepares them for the inferences they will need to make in AP stats or intro to Stats in college.   I would maybe try to look at comparisons and variability as well.  My college students do really well until the inference part.  If they had some experience with this part of statistics it would help a lot.

I also agree that students will pick up technology pretty quickly. If you are very worried about students not being able to get a hang of the resource  maybe just find part of the resource that you think is vital  save that webpage/file  and only show that to the students. Then they do not have to do the work of getting to the result themselves. This only works if you are able to still have the students achieve the exploration they would have had with the technology resource  though.

When developing questions or collecting data it is crucial to make sure that both components are representative of the point that you are trying to make.

By this I mean  location of city/town  and what age level. I certainly wouldn't expect many elementary kids to be walking to school or driving a car  but would be expecting them to be taking a school bus. I also wouldn't expect as many kids in a very large city to be taking a car. Coming from a small town  the majority of people at the high school level all had vehicles to take to school. That was by far the primary method followed by walking. School buses were typically for people that were in middle school to elementary. So I think knowing how the data was collecting and where from is important.

Without knowing the origins of the data is important for students to remain skeptical about how realistic the results are that the data is implying. This mindset is important for students to employ especially when they apply it to their daily lives such as when looking at surveys and data results in newspapers. It's important to look at who collected the data and the reasons behind collecting. This may lead to realization that the people collecting the data may be pushing you towards a certain conclusion.

I would think that digging more deeply into a statistical investigation would encompass many more standards than those just found in the statistics domain.  Also  personally  I am better able to make connections and remember my learning if I do it deeply  and I have seen this at several schools this year.  Students have better retention when the learning is deep and meaningful and  therefore  there is reduced re-teaching.     Saxon math was our curriculum when I first began teaching 6th grade 14 years ago  and those books quickly became stacked in a closet.

The longer I teach mathematics  the more that I struggle with marching through a textbook. There is so much more to mathematics  especially Statistics than marching through a series of concepts. I agree with Susan that you need to start with engaging questions. In the past I have frequently focused on the procedure and formula. I hope that I can now focus more on posing good questions and using the question to drive the investigation.

I definitely need to emphasize variability more. This has always seemed to be one of the toughest concepts for students to fully grasp  but the effort has to be made  since it is so fundamental in statistics.  I'm definitely going to use data sets and tools we worked with here to help me in this endeavor  and in others as well. There are great resources here that will be helpful to me and my students.

I know I will be guiding them a lot  but it will definitely make them look at the text (and all the concepts from this semester) as a whole and as a cycle to seeing the world in a brand new way. They will present the projects and will have to interact with the audience beyond just speaking from a powerpoint. It will be interesting to see what their minds will come up with!

Each student brought in and counted a bag and we graphed and analyzed the class data.

For example  if a graph was shown  was it shown to the correct scale or was it shown in a way to try and help or hurt a company. Too often we get tricked by the information given on tv due to its invalidity in statistics and it is a good skill to have to pick out the falseness the tv has. It was an awesome assignment and it really opened our eyes to the statistics that happen in our every day lives.

It combines hands on activity with stats and also food. With each student having their own bag and counting that bag everyone is involved and contributes to the data set. I'm curious what sorts of questions could be posed here? Maybe on average which m&amp;m color shows up more in a bag of m&amp;m's?    Something similar I've come across was done with skittles. This may be a bit more interesting as there are more colors.

I think it is a valuable lesson for students to see where statistics occurs in our everyday lives.

It was cool to see where statistics occurs in my community.

When I took statistics it did not usually relate to me or my community. I think that for students to get a useful experience in stats  they need to know that it will help them to make decisions and observations later in life. What your teacher did by having you do this project was prove that stats is a math that can be used daily and empowers students to understand and interpret the world around them.

No matter the grade level  I think that this could be very insightful as far as students' interests.  Sixth graders AND AP Stats students might actually ask very similar questions  but their analysis might vary in sophistication.  If there is a way to partner a middle school with a high school in the same statistical investigation  that could be REALLY interesting for them to exchange their findings...and maybe include some college-level stats students as well.   I believe that this could lead to all three levels seeing the big ideas more clearly.

That entire package put that material into an easy way to read and understand. It is a simple method that goes into detail and helps me understand each step better. This is my first course in statistics and I believe that it placed a great foundation for me to grow from.

I believe that once the framework is understood especially in the cycle form it guides the students through the whole process and makes it more engaging instead of tedious as many associate statistics with. Also of importance to me is the main point that was mentioned earlier about how we are accustomed to starting statistics sessions  I now see the importance of allowing and guiding the students through the whole process instead of only allowing them to start at the analyzing data as we are often used to.

I would love to hear more specifics about how the 4 phase cycle  the habits of mind  and the 3 levels of sophistication can really inform your practice!

I think that it will be very valuable to use in my classroom!

Without a doubt the introduction of the SASI framework was the most useful part of the MOOC for me too. I will definitely be administering this framework in my Statistics classes until it becomes second nature for my students that every time they're thinking about anything statistically significant that they consider the framework in mind.

Until I took this MOOC I thought of stats as another subsection of math  but not anymore. It definitely takes a different mindset to do statistics and it is a lot more than just finding the mean  median and mode of a data set.

I feel like this framework is great for teachers who are just starting to teach this subject because it gives them guidelines of where to begin and how to continue as opposed to just being thrown into the fire  so to speak.

You can get so caught up in the how to's and wherefore's of analysis  that you forget to step back and look at  What is this analysis telling me? Has my question been answered? Do I need to analyze the data in a different way? Have other questions come up that need to be considered? It's a critical step that can get overlooked.

These lessons would be used to develop a strong expertise with each aspect using a whole-part-whole instructional method. Teach the SASI framework as a whole  then break it down into the 4 parts and practice those skills  then go back to completing a whole project. The quality of student work may improve with this teaching progression.

So many textbooks break everything down into number crunching  and this shows the big picture.  I don't think that it was exactly the same  but the video of the teacher in Ireland showed the cycle displayed in the classroom for students as well.  That one boy asked another question  and the teacher pointed out that it IS a cycle and that investigations usually lead to further questions.

I am interested in either Option A or C.   I like to develop activities and to try to improve my lesson plans.   I am open to work with anyone who is interested in either Option A or C.

Fourteen years ago  my students had individual projects. For the most part  these were very meaningful as they collected real data. My university changed and made these as team-based projects. I have now returned to individual projects.   My courses are a short five or six weeks in length. The amount of real data collected tends to be a problem. However  students can data mine their company's database  or get data from external sources. I allow students to use surveys under certain conditions. One instance is where the student was an owner of her company and wanted to find out about her customers.   When data is unavailable  I will usually do one of two things. Provide the student with canned data  or create mock data. I prefer the latter if the student could use this research design in the future.   Just some thoughts.

Last year was my first year teaching AP Statistics but I have been teaching linear regression in Algebra 1 for 5 years and I find the things students relate to are what I try to find data on.  Fat content vs. calories - lots of data sources out there.  You could even ask students to create a data set for you from any of the major restaurant chain websites.  Rainfall or high/low temps in a city.  All available on the web. When doing comparisons with probability for z tests  I try to find comparisons between male/female for a certain topic - seat belt usage or something similar.  Funny but the book I use in my classroom always does things that are illegal or controversial- teenage drinking  teen tobacco use  teen pregnancy  seat belt use.  Kids can relate to it and there is certainly data out there but then I get off on a tangent about the ethics of said data.  Good luck with your project!

My role as a K-8 Math instructional specialist  I found Common Core 7th grade Stat standards 1-4 are challenging for teachers to unpack because those standards were not traditionally found in 7th grade standards in California. I'd like to use a task to engage teachers in the 4-step investigation process and to discuss the statistical habits of mind along the way. This task needs to be completed in a 4 hour PD and it needs to be relevant to 7th grade students so the teachers can implement this task in class. Of course the timeline for PD and for in-class implementation will be different. I also like to include digital simulation tools to get the bang for the buck.

My students are adult learners  who are working on their undergraduate or graduate degrees in Business Administration.    The Census at School provides many opportunities for data mining  setting up search parameters of their choice  cleaning the data  charting  determining normality  analysis  and interpretation. What I currently do not do: Have students set up search parameters  and clean the data.   Why do this? Many of my students are employed and work with some data or can collect performance data. My assignments focus on relevant lessons that involve their workplace. One area that has gone unfulfilled is the reality of real data. We do test for normality  but I have not introduced the data review process. If I want my students to be successful  they should know how to clean their data.

Rationale:          I am a 9<sup>th</sup> grade Algebra teacher.  This project is for a Regents (average)  level class.  They have spent a lot  of time on functions and are familiar with exponential  linear and quadratic  models.  I would like them to  collect data  plot it and find a function to best fit their data  using  technology.  This project is real  and will hopefully be interesting for the students.  By choosing their own topic and collecting their own data   students should have ownership of their data.  That will hopefully lead to more interest and motivation.

Are the students creating the graphs by hand? If so then you might extend the project and have them use technology (TI-83/84/89 calculators and/or Excel/Google Sheets) to plot the data and create best fit equations.

The first activity is to analyze gestation period and birth weight. Students are presented with a task list to facilitate their analysis. They must determine if invalid data should be removed and the best way to graphically represent both data elements. Then they must calculate mean and interpret results. The goal here for students to question useful data  to filter data  to understanding graphical representations and written descriptions of data. This is a level A activity where analysis and interpretation are required on given data.  The second activity is for students to create samples from the CensusAtSchool website for 2 states in the US and compare students travel times to school for grade 12 students. The data must be extracted  downloaded and filtered. Use of technology is key in this activity. Also included in this activity is the creation of box plots for the 2 states for comparison and explanation purposes. This is also a level A activity for given data and guiding questions lead to analysis.  The third activity is for students to decide what data they will use from CensusAtSchool to create a prediction. Guiding questions lead students to pose their own questions  methods  analysis and interpretations. This is a level C activity where students must create their own questions.  The three excel files are attached. Each file has an activity sheet with student tasks. Before each activity  students must be introduced to the technology (websites  excel  graphing calculator) if not proficient with it. Smaller activities can be introduced to learn the new technology.

I also struggle with that \spoon fed\"" attitude at the high school level. How does one build a culture of thinkers? As far as technology  I have students occasionally use Logger-pro to analyze data they enter and many tend to give up learning the program because there are many ways to look at the data graphically and they are reluctant to think about the meaning behind the variable. Correlation coefficients than become values that are either good or bad versus the mathematical reasoning behind their calculations. Same with the meaning of slope  linear regression  and lines of best fit. At the beginning of the year  all will initially draw lines with their data versus a scatter-plot. When asked to interpret the areas between the points  they are confused. Thanks for bringing this up.  """

Looking over many of the assessment items  I came up with a list of terms I do not remember from my past college-level stats classes and feel some of the terms used in the assessments are questions specific to the text and materials that must be used to be most successful with the material. What I did notice  however  was a requirement for higher-level thinking and memorization of these key terms and their respective applications. For example  I don't think some of the dot and leaf/whisker plot sets would be the best way to communicate the ideas but did make clear the necessity to be able to find quartiles relative to a median. Another set of terms was \practically significant vs \""statistically significant.\"" The issue of \""least squares\"" I also find questionable but would like to know the higher context involved with this requirement. I would think linear regression would be as far as you would get if you were serving a general population of students. Overall  I think there would be a large investment of time required in the meaning of vocabulary and working backwards to their relative applications """

They would not be able to successfully complete the LOCUS unless a complete statistics course was required. Those who do quantitative studies generally focus on a specific statistical test and the related  descriptive statistics. They too would have difficulty with some of the LOCUS items.  Unfortunately  many educators feel it is someone in the administration building who is responsible for data collection &amp; analysis and they just respond to it.

Not the end of the world  but we really struggle to get into some of the more mathematical concepts that would be necessary in a first year intro to college stats.

Students seem to pick multiple choice over selected or constructed response for multiple reasons but I offer the main reason is that they do want to expend the time required to think through a complete response. I am constantly exploring ways to get students to embrace a culture of deeper thinking but every year seems to present more and different challenges. Thus  our school dropped Stats class and now tries to incorporate stats using the McGraw-Hill ConnectEd series and textbooks which have units on stats and probability as well as series  combinations  and permutations. I also think hitting unprepared students too hard with higher-level thinking tends to decrease their confidence level which can also be detrimental to their engagement.

Before revamping my school's math 1 pacing guide  stats was always at the end  and usually would get pushed out if we got behind. Now we start with a univariate statistics unit and it has helped in being able to make connections to other topics as we move throughout the course.      I love the idea of collaborating with the science department to analyze data. I had not thought much about this  but will definitely ask my colleagues when the school year rolls around.

What to do?,9743,1700,1387,34264,16/06/24 15:23:28,34309,Re: Are Students Prepared?  What to do?, Agree with what has been said previously.  Engaging with statistics earlier in the year and aligning math and science instruction will enrich and deepen students understanding of the power of statistics.  I teach 6th grade math and science in CA.  Once again  after looking through many of the assessment questions on the CA State test  I realized that statistics is one area that seems to have a fair number of questions.  The gist of the questions focus on analysis and interpretation.  With statistics usually taught at the end of the year  students have not had adequate time to practice and develop their critical thinking skills around this topic.  In addition  grade 6 science topics focus on weather and climate.  To fully make sense of these topics  analysis and interpretation of small and large data sets.    This coming year we have moved the statistics unit to our first unit.  In many ways we feel that we can use the ideas behind this unit to understand who the typical 6th grader is in our school and to lay the ground work for what it means to collect  analyze  and  interpret data and use data to inform choices.  We are thinking this focus will provide students with powerful tools to understand their grades  to make sense of current events (particularly the upcoming presidential election as well as some issues around social justice) and to deepen their understanding of science concepts.  The LOCUS assessment questions seem like great places to start for designing or using  tasks to support the journey towards deepen one's statistics literacy skills.

We had a Stats course in the past but the teacher was not a mathematics teacher and admin cannot bring in a teacher specifically to teach stats. Therefore  we now use McGraw-Hills textbook series (2014) which incorporates Stats into each grade level. For instance  at the pre-calc level  the chapter starts out with Descriptive Statistics and begins with univariate data and skewed distributions. The unit covers box and whisker plots well but minimally covers quartiles. The chapter ends with Correlation and Linear regression. Generally  my students would be fairly prepared to answer the questions after an intensive study of this Stats chapter but depth of learning would be restricted by the time it took to cover the material at this depth I found some of the LOCUS questions (and I spent a few hours with them) would require specific familiarity with the vocabulary versus practical knowledge of statistics. Would these questions in LOCUS really assess a student's ability to make inferences  set up studies  and find proper conclusion? Partially perhaps. Would LOCUS accurately assess their ability to think and construct new knowledge? I would think better test takers would fair better than students that have test anxiety and those with better memories would score better given a timed test than those that require notes.

Almost 100% of his students missed the question on SBAC that covered that topic because he never taught the proper term.

I found this year that I had to start from the foundation and build up.  They did not have enough points of reference or even basic skills in statistics to be successful in the higher level thinking tasks that were expected of them.

I believe one of the problems  at least in the high school I teach in  is that Statistics is often left for the last topic of the school year  as a result  it is not given the time it deserves. I believe partially because in the past statistics has not been a major area of focus in the high school mathematics curriculum in my state.  Teachers end up glossing over some of the material  thus the students do not gain an in depth understanding of statistics.  Students are often taught only what they need for \the test\"".   """

This unit and work has been challenging for me  since it has been over 20 years since I took a Statistics course.  As a middle school teacher (prior to Common Core)  honestly creating box plots and identifying quartiles  median  etc. was as advanced as we did.  Statistics (data) was the fun unit.  A unit that our state test did not require (like maybe 10% of the end of year test)  so we never put emphasis in it in our curriculum because it was not deemed important.  Most recently  I have worked in elementary mathematics  where with Common Core  Statistics is non-existent.

I teach both Alg 2 and AP Statistics.  We don't teach anything beyond the basics of mean  median and mode and most years  stats is the first thing to get cut when there is a time crunch at the end of the year.  We have to start from the very beginning in AP.  I think one of the major road blocks is that teachers themselves don't know enough about statistics to know where to start when deciding what and how to teach statistics.  We weren't required to take much as far as statistics is concerned  and so the importance of the subject was never emphasized to us.

Too many times I have to start from ground zero with AP Statistics students and I also feel that even with the time crunched statistics given in Algebra 2 that will not be different.  Algebra 2 students though need more than 2 weeks to digest this information and that is really all of the time any teacher is willing to give to the topic since the course title is Algebra 2 and not Algebra 2 with Statistics.  This year I am considering building Statistics in once a week and using at a spiral and a way to connect into the other math of the common core rather than a stand alone topic at the end of the year.

They may be okay with answering questions 1 &amp; 5 (posing questions) and 2 (data collection) if presented in multiple-choice form  but I don't know if they would be able to come up these methods on their own if they were asked to design their own study.

These skills would be developed during a course so that the students would understand and be able to answer them correctly.

Giving them some sort of warning typically works well to help with the anxiety and just consistently having them answer questions gets them used to it and not so anxious. One year  I had each student's name on a popsicle stick and they knew that I could pull one at any time to ask questions and start discussions. This seems like it would cause a lot of anxiety  and it did at first  but as long as you set the right atmosphere in your classroom (don't allow teasing  encouraging students to take a chance  making mistakes is encouraged  etc) and use it often  the students adjust and even enjoy it by the end. Also  if you want to have them work in groups  you can just come up with some system that keeps track of who participates/speaks and have some requirement that asks students to participate in discussions.

It's also difficult if you are teaching statistics and you haven't taught the subject in a while.   The type of questions dealing with concept are great.  I like them but it's something that I was not exposed to as a student and would need to develop in myself as well as my students.  Getting them to shift their mindset as to why these type of questions are better than the formulaic/procedural type would be a lot of work because it is not something that students are exposed to with other math topics.

For instance  most students are not able to visualize that a graph of velocity describes the relative change of position of an object where a negative trend (line going down) can still mean a positive but slowing velocity.

There is a tension between who is doing the heavy lifting -- teacher or student and does providing notes really make a huge difference.  I have seen that for some students  yes  these notes are beneficial  especially when the student has taken apart and digested what the notes mean.  Working with students on putting the big ideas into their words offers them a chance to wrestle with and chew on the ideas.  Having the notes decreases the cognitive load and opens pathways to engaging with the big ideas in different ways.    I wonder what strategies do others use to facilitate a students engagement with texts (whether they be notes  word problems  graphs  etc.)?

Also  as the panel said  part of learning statistics is learning to use the technology involved. From what I've learned so far of AP stat  students use a TI-84 and that's about it.

I find students have never been taught how to think. This complicates teaching stats because I can only teach it as part of my path courses and not as a separate course. I try to incorporate metacognitive skills as much as I can and much of that uses ideas similar to the habits of mind we are learning here. Thus  I agree they need to experience stats vs just check off boxes from the state (and other) standards and say they know it. Therefore  I will allow the usual 10 days for pacing and if they only get through SDV  too bad. At least they will have learned Box plots  IQR  mean  median  range  domain  ID vs DV  spread  correlation  and variation. How to think about stats versus getting pushed through abstract measures of validity they will forget how to calculate will be my new goal. They should know there are measures of correlation and validity and know how to look at stats with a critical eye and know how to question what they see.

What I've noticed with the introduction of Common Core Statistics  is that each textbook (Algebra 1  Geometry  Algebra 2 - you can pick your publisher) now contains a chapter that teaches just enough statistics to be dangerous.

Our students worked as a data scientist and analyzed the data. This project is taught by my science collegues but they called me in for introducing the statistics part. I started with having the students collecting real data in the classroom (age  gender  etc.) in order to get some idea of the problems with collecting data and getting messy data (gender can be noted as male  female  m  f  man  woman  m  w  boy or girl or even 1 for male and 2 for female and in my language the abbreviation for girl and for man are the same so you get a real mess). Then they analyzed their own electricity bill to get used to the kind of information that was given on this bill like kWh and cubic metres for water and gas. Then they got the real data and we first tried to find out what these data were about. How were these variables measured and collected? What was the timescale? And then they started analyzing by making graphs with univariate  bivariate or multivariate data. Unfortunately all the materials are in Dutch otherwise I could send you my lesson plan.

For the last eight years I have had students go from start to finish in a question of their own design and helped them to develop a worthwhile project that allows them to go through this process.  The students tend to remember the process of statistics more and are better able to ask questions about new data sets  but you are right  the pace of AP Statistics does not lend to examining this aspect very deeply.

Also  since the activity asks for both a confidence interval and a significance test  I would guide students to look for a connection between the results of these two inference procedures and ask which one gave better information in this context. Finally  I might consider bringing in another variable such as gender  and asking students to analyze the results in a two way table  as well as an appropriate graph. Then I may suggest a Chi square test for independence to see if there is an association between gender and taste choice.  """

Everyone who drives an automobile is interested in gas mileage. I use this task in my classes.   Improvement 1: I used a dataset of various automobiles  which included MPG and vehicle weight. It was never a surprise that cost of ownership increased as the weight was increased. My college students used regression analysis.   Improvement 2: This could involve the entire class. Students would identify the automobile model  and keep track of the mileage and number of gallons consumed. Knowing the model could determine the vehicle's weight. Each student would provide this information over a few weeks (or so). This task could then bring up some issues with sampling.

One suggestion as to how to improve the task  especially for introductory level statistics students  is simply to ask students the significance of the slope and y-intercept  in words.  I've found that lower level students really struggle to grasp what those numbers mean.   I agree that this is more of a mathematical task than a statistical one.  It's essentially checking to see if students can perform the computation.  I think students would benefit from a visual representation of the data.  They could discuss outliers.  Another meaningful extension would be to research how fuel efficiency has changed throughout history.  I'm thinking of the bubble charts that were used in GapMinder.

To make it more statistical  if the data set is available  asking students how to display the data in a graph would be the first step in the \analyze\"" phase.  From there  looking at direction of the scatterplot and drawing connections to trends in context would improve the \""interpret\"" phase. Also  looking for outliers and brainstorming explanations would be interesting in this context. Even if a data set is not available  at least graphing the regression line can give some basis for trends in context  although that could also be done with the correlation coefficient. Again  even without the data  a question could be posed to the class about which is the explanatory and response variable. Questions should also be raised about the accuracy of the predictions from the regression equation  given that it was unclear whether a sample or census was used to get the measures of center and spread.

This is my \go to\"" (using math vs the conceptual end of things) when I teach due to my preference for the math involved vs the overall context. I am pondering how I would get my high school students to conceptualize the values of least squares and what they really mean vs just adding values into a program and spitting out results. At the college level  is the conceptual understanding expected of students? I am not currently sure how to approach this least squares issue for intro stats HS students and will begin now to look into ways to complete the PPDAC process into such a task.

I have found that  frequently  they lack the worldly insight to understand many of the functions that statistics are used in daily.  For example  try explaining auto insurance loss ratings to a group of high school seniors!  (Or any manufacturing type scenario!)  But I could pose a question about which type of car would be the most cost effective for students to own.  As a class we could brainstorm which attributes would likely be drivers of the cost  and then use pre arranged (but real world) datasets to compare the impact of these drivers in a bivariant quantitaive analysis.  We could predict the cost associated with some of the cars driven by our students for the different variables.

However  at the college level this could be expanded to cover questions or may make assumptions students already have the overall Pose phase down. At the high school level where I teach  administrators may like the rigor of such math but the task would require me to first explain the math and its inherent value tied to analysis and then revisit the task. I fear I would lose my students to lack of motivation along the way and they would not want to regurgitate the task.

I find most students have trouble with these concepts unless they have already employed habits of mind in earlier courses where they investigated such things. Even those that are supposedly ready for calculus seemingly have never had to develop their own means to represent proof of a conjecture. Thanks for sharing your ideas and experience.

I love how they used the dots and x's but on the same graph and stacked on top of each other.  Many students would make different assumptions because they would focus on the shape.  I also think it was interesting to talk about the title and we don't know if this is in a week  a month  etc?  This could spark some discussion on how to make stronger/better.  Would be a great opening activity for graphical display and analysis lesson.

I do feel like it is more mathematical than statistical.  Yes they are looking for patterns  however  I am not sure if this task really will have students invested in the learning.  It is far different from my favorite task in the middle school tasks of Old Faithful.  That task provided many opportunities for students to be involved in decisions of the task.  I agree that this could be a good class opener.  I think I would first have students make sense of the data by asking them if they could represent the data in a different graph/way.  I think it would give students opportunity to make sense of the data as well as choosing a different representation that may be a better way to represent the data.  I also think this question is simple enough to take own class data and compare their data with the data of these two classes as well.

It appears the only goals of this lesson would be to make a bar graph and answer a question that may assume incorrectly the results mean something  Another possible goal would be to get students to read the graph carefully as each data plot is a person and the chart seems to be looking for how many hours specific numbers of students generally spend watching TV. Why is it important to know 4 students from Jebson's class watch 20 hours of TV last week versus 2 students from Lee's class? What would affect these results over a larger time? I do not think the lesson would hold students' interest as I do not see how this would be relevant unless applied to a larger question or investigation. This task fails the Pose section in my opinion. Also  ditto for Data and Context; the students should have been collecting the data. and the context I find weak. Analysis and interpretation could have more value if as expanded as previously noted.

I agree with others comments that this might be more interesting if students gathered data from their own class. It would be interesting to see how students decided to gather data. Will they self report their best estimate of hours watched in a week? Will they create some sort of log to record TV watching time for a week?   Also  why do we care about hours spent watching TV? Are we interested in seeing if TV watching is correlated with better or worse grades? This could easily be translated into an interesting 8th grade question (where bivariate data is studied) by adding another variable that students are interested in. """

While it only requires students to  complete the Interpretation portion of the statistical cycle  it does pose  thoughtful questions without being leading or overwhelming.  I actually like that this task focuses on the  interpretation of the data because it would lead to a class discussion where  groups had to defend their conclusions.  My  students typically do well with displaying data but need extra practice  defending and justifying their conclusions.  Struggling students can gain a lot from hearing  other students justify their conclusions.         I would extend this activity by asking my students to  critique the data collection process  (sample  population and size) as well as the graphical representation.

I also have reservations that the question will be of interest to students who consume media in so many other ways than television (only my parents watch TV).  The analysis aspect for this question is also lacking.  This feels to me a very typical statistical task that my students already do in 7th or 8th grade.

Students may then restate the problem come up with a more concise question based on their audience. Using data across different classes and school years would also be valuable to analyse trends. Interesting idea about the Brown eyes vs others. You may want to include something on the Jane Elliot Brown-eyes Blue-eyes experiment in the late 60s and the effects it had on society.

Talk to your PE teachers or Health Occupations teachers to see if there is a standard way to measure balance and the norms  and see if they can demo measuring for your class. Perhaps your students are interested in a career of this type! But notice that gender is still a column heading on those charts. It does make me wonder  how do those in the medical field read these standardized norms when gender is involved for those who identify as gender neutral?

The students were given a lot of autonomy to look through the data  both in table and graphical representation formats  before they began analyzing the data and interpreting their results.  think the task could be improved by building out the interpreting their results section  in that more than just making a graph and defending their answer I would like to see the students explain their process  engage with the variability  and make inferences about what their results could mean for others.  High School Task 2: Pepsi vs. Coke Activity - I appreciated how this task incorporated randomization into the data collection and a personalization to the data as it was learner generated. However  I think there is a missed opportunity by not having the students pool their data from all of their small groups when calculating the confidence intervals. Also the task was focused on calculating statistical tests (confidence interval and hypothesis test)  which are important but I think it would be helpful for the students to analyze their data graphically before calculating tests so that they can engage with the data and look at it before calculating a number.

As I recently used a real data set of an electricity company with my students that was the first thing the students had to do. They had to find out what kind of data they have got  how it was measured  how it would relate to what is usual for these kind of data (e.g. a Dutch electricity bill for a family is around 3300 kWh per year so anything above 5000 kWh per year has to be critically examined and explained (big house  many children  old house  etc.)

MPG,  Task # 1 for HS students is the car  weight vs MPG scenario.  Classic  statistics question used in Algebra 1 classes as well as AP Statistics is how  to make a best fit line with the data provided. The learning goal would be How  can students use data to create a model which could then be used to find the  MPG for any weight car? Data is already given to the students as the task wants  us to use the model to find the b value however they could have done the  research themselves easily using car company websites and had their calculators  find the line of best fit. I do believe it is valuable because most students  understand a heavier car will have lower gas mileage per gallon. You see a  negative correlation coefficient which shows the students it will have a  negative slope and then the student can test the line of best fit with real  data to see whether it is close to what the model suggests. I would like the  task to pose a question first and then dive into the data  formulas and the  other questions.  If the student knew  what they were trying to answer first  it might make the project more  relatable.   So the things I would change  would be to pose a question first especially for the Algebra 1 students and  then allow the students to use real world car data to confirm their model holds  across all types of cars.

No further thought about a small simulation or certainly needing to see a graph.  The middle school students used probably all the knowledge they had by increasing their simulation.

The task was simply to determine if the dice were fair and  with technology  running large sample sizes would prove the fairness one way or the other. Since they did not run larger sample sizes they relied on the chi-square test  but did not give a full explanation. The AP students did not complete the task fully and therefore I would not consider it to be more sophisticated.  This task required that students understand what the outcome should be if the dice were fair. Then using technology and large enough sample sizes students had to show evidence for their reasoning.

They correctly supported their claims with the level of statistics that they were taught.  On the other hand  the AP statistics students understood the steps  the procedure  however  they were lacking in some conceptual understandings.  They failed to fully investigate the problem.   I believe pairing students at different conceptual and procedural levels can be very helpful to student learning outcomes.  I also think that student personalities and work habits need to be taken into account when pairing students.  Perhaps if the teacher of the AP Stats students paired the students up differently  a visual student ( so they would have used graphs) with a procedurally strong student  together they would have explored the question differently.

The technology tool moves them to to next phases that students often don't get to.  I also think that it is motivating and appealing to students.

I have been taught to always have students carry out an experiment by hand before using technology to simulate a large number of trials. While weighted dice are not easy to come by  I wonder if having students toss a fair die several times and create a graph of the distribution of outcomes before running the simulation would be valuable in the Schoolopoly task. In particular  for students working on Level A on the SASI Framework  I think discovering the importance of sample size would come quicker if several trials on a fair die were conducted by hand before going to technology.

Since not all of my students have a stats background we do a quick coin flip activity to introduce chi square.  I find that having them flip two coins for 100 trials is valuable because it lets them see how technique (and other variables) factor into this. This allows them to open their minds to alternative explanations of the results when we start looking at inheritance data. Yes  it is tedious  but important for my students. There is another activity that we do with a random number generator and it gives them the opportunity to have very large sample sizes (we still do a small version as a hands-on activity so they understand what led to the data. I have found that if I skip that step then the numbers obtained through technology are meaningless to many of them.)

I definitely agree with others in this post that students should have a grasp of what the technology is simulating (maybe early in the year do a hands-on task and discuss randomness)  but at this stage  the goal is to determine if the dice is fair.  Hopefully  the foundation has been laid so that this task is presented at the appropriate time.

I use technology when I want students to see a big concept or investigate a task (like the central limit theorem). I don't want them bogged down in creating histograms and measures of center/spread by hand because I want them focusing on what is going on as we draw larger and larger samples.  However  I also use manipulatives like dice and coins when appropriate.

The reason for using a Chi-square test is we want to determine whether each outcome is equally likely  as we'd predict if the dice are fair.  The reason they were not able to reject the null hypothesis is that there sample size was only 100  so there was a 27% that the differences from the expected outcome occurred by chance.    A deeper understanding of the interpretation of the test would hopefully allow the students to take the next step of increasing the sample size and repeating the test.

Most of what you say is correct.  Just a few gentle corrections:   <ol><li>The Chi-Square test they ran was a specific kind called a \Chi Square Test of Homogeneity.\""  There are actually several different Chi-Square tests.  The students ran the appropriate test but they could have also ran this test even if they were testing that each roll of the die was coming up some specific  but different value.  As a clarifying example  you could run a Chi-Square test to determine whether M&amp;Ms in a bag are appearing in the distribution stated by the Mars Company.  But it is NOT the case that the null hypothesis is that all colors are equally likely.  I actually do this very activity with my AP Stat students and they really enjoy it.  See here:  <a href=\""http://www.northlandprep.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/MM-ChiSquare-Lab.pdf\"">http://www.northlandprep.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/MM-ChiSquare-Lab.pdf  </a></li><li>The reason they were not able to reject the null is NOT because n = 100.  The reason they were not able to reject the null is because of natural variation.  They just didn't get a sample extreme enough to reject the null.  But n = 100 was NOT an invalid choice.  As they showed in their work  the assumption required to run a chi-square test WAS met (expected cell counts all above 5).  The statistical term for what happened to the kids is Type 2 error.  They got a special kind of \""unlucky\"" - they were unlucky in that their data just happened to be a little too close to the null hypothesis in order to provide sufficient evidence against the null.  </li><li>With respect to the P-value  your interpretation is close.  The exact phrasing is  \""There is a 27% chance we would see results *at least* as extreme as the results we saw assuming the null hypothesis is true.\""  That notion of \""at or more extreme\"" is crucial to student understanding of P-value.  </li></ol> Hope this helps!  :)    """

It is important to visually inspect the data to see if the conclusion you actually prove makes sense to the data set that you have.

However  when students are simply given data  they often struggle to form appropriate questions.  As was mentioned in another post  students are accustomed to starting with a stated question and then hunting for the \right\"" answer.  Data will (and should) usually lead to more questions  not necessarily answers.  If they don't know the means of collection  they may feel like they are just staring at a bunch of numbers.

In NJ some students may travel more than 60 minutes by bus to get to vocational/specialized high schools. For the start of the school year  students should begin to think about data and possible questions to investigate. It would be a good activity to focus on one specific variable and then list all student generated questions based on the variable. The teacher can then guide the class to determine 1) if the data should be filtered and why  2) if the questions require revision and should be more specific  and  3) what calculations are needed. Students responses to this data will change as the course progresses and the data can be revisited each time a new concept is covered. This would be a good exercise to see how student thinking changes as new methods are introduced and the sampling distributions are studied.

We asked the students in the school to fill out a paper and pencil survey.  This was moderately successful but the students did not realize how tedious entering the information into Excel and the TI-Nspire would be.  We also spent considerable time discussing the wording of questions to try to eliminate some biased language. The best method in my opinion was using Google Docs and then putting the survey on the school survey for a window of time (ours was 2 hours when we had extended homeroom).  It was a great experience for my students as they saw how messy data can be sometimes and some responses evoked great discussion whether to keep or eliminate pieces of data. The toughest questions for students to come up with were questions that were quantitative in nature  as they wanted to ask only categorical questions. I am currently reconsidering whether the time it takes to conduct this survey and analyze the data is worthwhile. Do other teachers have similar concerns?

This was done after the AP exam as we have about 4 weeks of time in NY State after the AP exam but before the end of the school year.  Google Forms was easy to set up and helpful to get many answers back to their surveys quickly so they could move on to the next part of the project.  And yes some students who took surveys were not completely honest.  But I tried to teach the students who were making the surveys to make sure the question did not lend itself to any problems. Multiple choice as much as possible.   I guess you would need to reflect on whether a survey would need to be thrown out if it was not taken seriously.

With the exception of two semester projects  I do not give my students enough opportunities to pose their own questions  and this is something I hope to change in the upcoming school year. My students sometimes struggle with knowing which inference procedure is appropriate to answer a given question. Rather than only having them practice choosing the right inference procedure after receiving the question   I can envision asking students to pose a question that would require them to use a given inference procedure. For example  \What question can you formulate using the Census at School data that would require you to use a confidence interval for a proportion?\""  """

This video did a great job showing productive struggling and I could easily see my kids use this as a model to understand how to formulate the best question.  I also like your idea of using Census at School to eventually lead into the confidence intervals and what they actually mean.  Using it from the beginning will really help make that part more fun and engaging for the students.

I do like to put them in pairs/groups  which helps them to some extent come up with their own questions regarding some real-world issue/or particular problem that they find interesting.   I do like the idea of having them pick their own data sets  instead of me just providing them the data. I think this upcoming semester I'm going to give them more agency in the selection of data sets throughout the semester. Maybe this might make it more engaging/interesting.

When we had time to explore the C@S data  each of us likely considered different attributes that were interesting to us.  I think in the investigative cycle  we too often jump over the posing question phase and start collecting data for someone else's question.  Here  the two phases are reversed.  Students are given a massive amount of data and the questions should emerge organically.

I do wonder though as we are teaching our students how to ask questions if we also need to be aware that refining a question to make it more specific to what we are interested in answering with the data is one approach  but it is also remarkably similar to defining the question based on what we see in the data. I worry that the later is not what we want to teach our students to get in the practice of doing. As we all know to well  data can be used to state whatever you want. It seems like it may be worthy of a conversation with our students to think about the fine line between developing a specific question to investigate the data to answer and developing a question to demonstrate the relationship that we want the data to demonstrate.

What  I really liked where the tests for reactivity/memory. I tried it myself and I enjoyed it. This gave me an idea to have my students collect their data about themselves  then to have them analyze the data... I could even have the students compare this data with other students in dyads or in a group context. Who's faster in reactivity? Who's got a better memory? It would be fun to have them ask questions regarding their own data given these fun tests.

This is definitely a valuable resource to collect sizable data. I plan to use it to investigate the correlation between the arm span and height with my 8th grade students.

I was shocked at how the question the students posed changed as they discussed transportation to school.  It was also interesting to see the student eliminate different modes of transportation and narrowed it down to the top three.  Then the student also eliminated all the students who said their transportation took more than an hour.  I was very skeptical on them eliminating these data points as they are eliminating data points based on the assumption it wouldn't take some one over an hour to arrive at school.   In order to use the data from census at school  my students would have to have a knowledge in Microsoft excel to help them narrow down the messy data.  I think it is a great way to get quick and helpful data points in the classroom.

However that is a naive mistake that many students make and that as teachers I think it is our job to ask them why they have eliminated it.  I find when I have students collect data in class projects that they are quick to eliminate data points without really thinking about the variability.  I think reminding students that variability is part of real life and that it is important to consider in all aspects.  If the video had said that their school district had a policy of all transportation to school would take less than an hour then it would make sense to limit that data point.  I live in a rural district and the average bus ride to school is probably 45 minutes.  This video made me think that I would want to generate some data from our school to determine the actual transportation time as it is a hot topic here.

Do you need to modify your question?\""  I can also ask  \""What is your reasoning for deleting travel times over an hour?

I think building off of your idea and the Pfannkuch et al. (2010) resource it would be great to have the students develop their own table of the evolution of their questions. In the first column they could list their questions and then in the second column they could list the limitations of that question based on the data and/or why they no longer think that is the best question and thus think it should change. I wouldn't do this for every activity  but it would be interesting to observe their evolution of thinking as well as help them see their evolution of thinking about a question in regards to the available data.  I find that coming up with that good testable question is often the hardest part of with the students and teachers that I work.

I could see them going in the wrong direction at many stages during the activity  like we saw in the videos.   In posing questions  the students in the video I thought did well. However  I think it would take time to foster this in the classroom. Most students are not used to asking their own questions  but with a little practice  I think this would easily go away and is extremely important in getting the students engaged with the lesson.  In collecting data  I also thought that it was good to see in the videos that the students questioned how it was collected and that they threw out the 5000 to 10000 minute datum. This is something that I think would also be a challenge to get students to do. I think it would take time again to build up the students' ability and confidence to reason with the data enough to actually throw out messy data.  When analyzing the data  the students in the video threw out too much data. I could see this being a problem with students once they got comfortable with the idea of \cleaning\"" up the data. They might think that \""oh  this data doesn't look how we want it to  so lets throw it out\"". Teaching them to clean up data has the potential for them to go overboard.  When interpreting results  the video students did well with connecting it back to context  but they had cut out so much  that their conclusions were truly valid/meaningful anymore.  Overall  I think the best way to overcome these challenges is just to expose students to this process and way of thought early on and frequently. When thinking about this in my own classroom though  time becomes a factor. I can imagine an activity like this taking much too long  although it is very worthwhile for students to grapple with these issues.    """

I don't currently teach a statistics course  but I can imagine that it would be difficult for students (especially the younger students) to think beyond the community in which they live and their own experiences and they may toss out relevant data.

I just knew students would ask difficult questions that I couldn't answer. They did. As an online instructor  I could always read up and present an explanation the following day. By the end of the day  having this asynchronous delay was good for a beginning instructor.   Later  I began teaching college students face-to-face. Again  my fears arose because I was learning how to run a class. While there were few questions that I didn't know the answer (or the class didn't know the answer)  I came to realize the being honest was the best approach. I would just say  that was a good question  and I will provide feedback the following day. And I did.  As a student  I didn't expect professors always to know the answer. In reflection  how did I like the teacher to respond? I have never been offended when an instructor said  good question  I don't know - but I will get back to you (and does). What bother me was a perfunctory response or told to look up the answer (without guidance). My favorite response  \I don't know why you don't understand this material.\"" I find it more important on how I respond to an interested student than worrying about not knowing the answer.   """

Our resources are also limited in staff and budget. However  I now feel confident enough with the resources we have used here to start a separate Stats course and to align it with the mathematical modeling techniques seemingly improving student motivation and depth of thinking. This goes beyond the curriculum we now use where Stats is embedded in each grade levels' textbooks and materials. There is not enough time during the school year to adequately cover each section of stats in a manner that will allow students to use prior knowledge and build on new knowledge. In other words  they will forget what they learn using current methods. Since I am part of the curriculum development process  I now feel very confident I can develop a course in Stats to fit our students' needs and integrate other math concepts into such a course so that other standards are covered than just what the Virginia SOLs call for. I am also confident I can begin training other teachers to adopt more Math-modeling techniques into their courses.

Every year  we end the year with a statistics chapter in the algebra course I teach.  I've asked questions to our AP Statistics teachers about what can be covered in the classroom to help the student if/when they reach that level.  I just never have the confidence that I am teaching statistics correctly or in a way the students will retain the skills as they move forward in other courses.    What I did learn through this MOOC is it is not always about the correct answer in statistics but the discussion that surround the data.  Students can work through these 4 phases at any level.  I believe the students would be confident in posing a question and collecting the data.  But the analyzing and interpreting might not go so well the first couple of times for students.  As a teacher  I need to get my students to this level more often with their own discussions and deeper understanding to help them grow to be statistically literate.  It is these moments where I need to let the student lead their own work and trust them to be able to complete the lesson!

I am relatively new to teaching statistics and this site looks like a great way to incorporate topics and issues that my students will relate to.

I do have a question about the site and your plans to use it... do you plan to use it merely as a resource to see how data can be found and interpreted?

They really came on the scene with publicity in the 2008 election because they got so many things right at so many levels. Nate's site was then brought under the umbrella of the New York Times for a while where he also did sports forecasting. Eventually the name and site was purchased by ESPN. They continue to use statistics to predict politics as well as sports  and have a number of podcasts in addition to the website itself. Great stories  interesting discussions of good data or good polling vs questionable  etc. Check them out :).

I have never heard of the site before your original post and have been checking it out for the last 20 minutes.  I love that it encompasses so many different topics and includes so many that are relevant to our students.  I'm already thinking of using some of the political ones since it's such a big topic at the moment.  Even though my students are too young to vote they see so much information about the upcoming election in their social media and in their homes from their family members.  It can also be a great opportunity to incorporate Social Studies into Math with something that is actually going on around them at this moment.

I sometimes use similar articles in class to give students the opportunity to check the validity of an argument and form their own conclusion. For example  last semester  I used <a href=\http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/13/magazine/13Fob-wwln-t.html?_r=0\"" target=\""_blank\"">this article from the NY Times</a>. I used some basic literacy strategies to frame it into a lesson. So before reading  students made a prediction. During reading  students annotated. After reading  students organized the numbers given from the article in a graphic organizer to better display the results. And as a whole group  we discussed their conclusions and the implications of the article. My goal for these particular students was to expose them to more examples of using two-way tables  but a few students chose to use a tree diagram  so it was an added bonus review! """

Last year the local community paper reported how their local public HS students scored in the top 10% for the ACT. I work at a private school in this city. After looking into the stats  only about 0.1% of the school's students where represented and those that were are not a representative sample of the school as they tended to be exceptional students. The paper made the school appear to be in the top 10% of national scores as a general population at the school but the students were able to reason through this after questioning and deeper analysis. It was interesting to compare their initial impression with what was developed using good habits of mind after analysis.

Maybe we need more looks at the strand over the grade levels so that the high school teachers know what we have attempted to give in background experiences.

We use the McGraw-Hill series of textbooks (2014) and their section on course level statistics is spread over later chapters 10 and 11 in the pre-calc text and chapter 11 in the pre-calc text.  I will be looking for ways to expand the stats section to incorporate key concepts and practice earlier by jumping earlier sections. For calculus I hope to be able to incorporate more work with statistics and look forward to gaining information I will need to do this effectively in this course.

Great topic to bring up. Unfortunately  I'm not much help...  Many students (especially my special needs students) have a hard time grasping statistical concepts  because they never truly understood the basics. Sure maybe they can find the mean  median  etc. but do they truly understand what it means? Do they know how to apply it to the data they are trying to analyze or data they collected... typically no.  By making the data connect to a specific topic that each student connects to has been helpful in trying to build the connection  but still is a tough process. I've tried modeling scenarios and explaining examples in various ways... then trying to have them do some independently or in small groups. However  I sometimes find then they can only mimic the examples I just gave.

I've taught algebra with a team teacher (special education) for the past 3 years as well as an algebra support which was dominated with students with disabilities.  I feel algebra is an easier task for these students since it is more of a process they can follow.  I often feel I do not prepare them well for geometry (all the definitions  proofs  theorems) and statistics would fall into this category as well.  For the students to truly understand the different studies and processes in data collection would be difficult.

My equivalent. I moved my household to another country then learned enough about the culture to survive. Wherever we moved  there was always something that reminded me of home. This \thing\"" was a comforting and tended to relax the stress.   In my opinion  having students choose their real data has several benefits.   a. It is something that students are familiar and one less barrier;   b. Students will see how statistics is applied to something that is tangible;   c. Real data may have flaws that will need to be fixed (Webster brought this up).   I used academic datasets for years. I had about eight to ten sets  and students would choose one for the course. Students would then build a scenario  business problem  and research question around the dataset.   Recently  I began having students develop a problem then identify the variables and find data to support these parameters. Real data does take more time. I will always have a backup plan should data not be found or if the collection doesn't go very well.  """

Great resource. I think using real data has the advantage of authenticity and that in itself will tend to increase student motivation. Doubly so if the data pertains to something that interests the student. One way I will use the data is with parachute terminal velocities dealing with my students that are involved in the Teen America Rocketry Challenge. They would vary chute size based on smaller masses and chute sizes than the app shown but they would be able to adapt the same algorithms. I also like the TUVA data on electoral votes and would likely use that this fall before the elections.

Sometimes I think it it wonderful if the students can collect their own data  such as in the Pepsi vs. Coke task.  I believe it makes the tasks more meaningful for the students.

Perhaps this is why my students have trouble remembering the basics from one year to the next. Thus  I have been struggling this week to find a way to visualize the meaning behind the summation of variances squared divided by n (average areas  <span style=\color: rgb(51  51  51); font-family: UniversRoman  Arial  sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 22.4px; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; display: inline !important; float: none; \"">¬µ</span>) vs (<i>s</i>) where areas squared are divided by n-1 for sample populations. Does anyone have graphical or visual ways of explaining why SDV is what it is? Is there a way for students to be guided into construction of the equation based on reasoning and graphics beside actually showing the curves and integration? Why does one deviation contain 68% of the data? What happens if they box each variance on a graph and find the average of the areas? Would this latter value approximate  the same avg variance as if just the <span style=\""color: rgb(51  51  51); font-family: UniversRoman  Arial  sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 22.4px; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; display: inline !important; float: none; \"">one dimension variance to the mean is used? </span>Thanks in advance if you get this post and have any tips.

Have you tried building conceptual understanding with TinkerPlots?  Take a look at the following website:  https://tinkerplots-math.wikispaces.com/Standard+Deviation+%26+Rat+Terriers.  While this isn't my work  I have used TinkerPlots to do this sort of thing and find it to be very useful.  Unfortunately  the static images shown on the website do not illustrate the power in the dynamic environment.  Within TinkerPlots  representations are linked and changes to individual cases result in real time changes elsewhere within the file.

Looking at SDV in the content section of Tinker Plots  I definitely can use the dot-plots to illustrate what standard deviation covers and have students actually calculate percentages of data for 1 and 2 deviations and compare that with established norms. However  I did not find any graphics that explain or visualize why SDV use the average of the summation of variances squared. Likewise with the recursive part (n-1) for sample populations. Should students just accept this as an abstract value to be memorized or is there a way to explain this part of the SDV equation graphically. I will keep exploring. Thanks again for the tip; Tinker plots will definitely be part of my tool kit.  <span style=\line-height: 22.4px;\"">https://tinkerplots-math.wikispaces.com/Standard+Deviation+%26+Rat+Terriers</span>  """

I'm using made up data  say score on an 8 point quiz  so will demonstrate the concept--- ie make a dotpot of the data: 1  3  3  3  3  4  5  5  7  8 and draw a vertical line where the mean 4.2 is (this works well in tinkerplots!).  How does the data deviate from the mean?  students can calculate the deviations from the mean for the data points above the mean (8.2) then calculate the deviations from the mean for the data points below the mean (-8 2).   the mean is the \""balancing point\"".   What is the \""average\"" distance from the mean?  if you try to add the deviations and divide by 10  you can't average (=0).  Standard deviation squares the deviations  then averages  then square roots the variance to get back to the original unit.  The MAD  mean absolute deviation sums the absolute value of the deviations  then finds the average deviation from the mean.  On the dotplot students can also put vertical lines representing one SD or 1 MAD above and below the mean.   Is a score of 6 within the \""average\"" distance from the mean?  Explain.  Is a score of 2?  Explain.  Tinkerpots allows students to draw the plots  compare SD and MAD and answer much more interesting questions than this made up example!!          """

Grouping these together into one class is not necessarily bad.  However  Dr. Webster West said that when they are taught at the same time  there usually is a lot more probability that is taught  and hardly any statistics.  I agree with this from my own experiences.  This is a good point that he brought up...and a reason why so many of us have a limited understanding of statistics.

I feel more comfortable with probability over statistics.  I also feel that I can great more engaging lessons with probability.  It is a struggle of mine and hope through this training I will feel more comfortable teaching statistics beyond just collecting data making graphs  and a small amount of analyzing/interpreting the data as this is what is currently done in our algebra curriculum.

Therefore they allow teachers to focus on a different topic all at once. Almost allowing their brain to think differently for a unit. 2. both use sets of data.  You can use the same data sets for different problems (statistics or probability) 3. While statistics and probability use different ways to analyze and interpret the data  they both are estimates or approximations of an outcome happening.    I like them being together

However  I'm not sure anyone would jump at the opportunity to teach an introductory course even if we offered one.  Like me  most of my colleagues have had little/no exposure to statistics and feel ill-prepared to teach an entire course on the subject.  Coupled with the fact that our school no longer uses textbooks  teachers are responsible for developing all of their own materials needed for instruction.  I feel like in many schools the responsibility of teaching stats is going to fall on the new generation of teachers.

If the data is significantly skewed  which measure would you use to describe the distribution?

When I taught middle school over 10 years ago  we often discussed when to choose mean  median or mode to summarize data.  My degree is in middle school mathematics and my latest position was working with elementary teachers.   Textbooks do this  and it is frustrating.  However  some of the more project based texts do teach this concept the best  in a more authentic and real approach.  Its the traditional text that I think some districts are trying to get away from (but they still exist) and lack of professional development for teachers in statistics is also an issue.

I will have them use a normality test to decide clearly on whether the data is normal. If the data is normal  they will use mean and standard deviation. If the data is not normal  they will use the median and IQR.   There are instances where the mean is close to the median with normal data. The mean is emphasized because it uses all of the data in the calculation. The same goes with standard deviation.   I'm trying to bring awareness that using a means to represent the center of significantly skewed data is not the best measure.

As a HS teacher  this is big!  Another example for cleaning data is a program I had students work that had them take telemetry data off an Arduino into an Excel file in  a rocket they built and launched. The data entered in a way where students had to make sense of the numbers  separate them  and attempt to make meaningful graphs. The data was GPS  barometer  temp  pressure  velocity all in a single line of cells of tens of thousands of data points. One of the first things they had to do to clean the data was to eliminate the data of when their rockets where in launch position (not moving) and taking data. This eliminates thousands of data points. Second  some of the data points were inadvertent errors. For example  a velocity reading that spikes say 100 meters per second  where the dp/dt at that point approaches 3 meters per second. These can also be filtered. So the data generated was genuine but not effectively functional without being cleaned. Of course habits of mind come into play as students must learn what to filter  how  and when.

I also think students can look at the way the questions are worded and discuss how they could be changed or lead to some variability in responses.  I'm specifically thinking of the length of the index finger question (is it fingertip to knuckle?).  With any measurement  it is important for students to understand the task must be done in the same way.  When there is room for different interpretations  it leads to problems.  That's why I really appreciate the videos where it shows the students' process through the task of posing a question  collecting then analyzing data and then interpreting results  especially when they are operating at different levels.

Collect Data  III. Analyze Data  IV. Interpret Results  Secondly  I better understand the maturity levels.  A. Beginning awareness of the statistics question distinction  B. Increased awareness of the statistics question distinction  C. Students can make the statistics question distinction  I don't believe these are unique to K-12. I was a GA for several Educational doctoral quantitative classes  and these students progressed through the three levels. Perhaps  they learned faster than my undergrad students. I would say that faculty should have this awareness to scaffold their lessons.   Why have two GAISE reports? Perhaps one GAISE report would be sufficient with an additional section for higher ed.

I have been using this type of design for years without knowing there was a name.  My students (average age 35) learn stats that are relevant to their experience. My courses provide statistics in a process format that is transferable immediately to the students' workplace. Students conduct a literature review  develop a sampling design  and learn enough descriptive and inferential statistics to answer their research questions. I cover all of the habits of mind  but I know there is still room for improvement (on my part).   I will introduce this framework when I become a subject matter expert for my university. We have undergraduate and graduate courses  and currently  each one is different in structure and content. SASI provides a visualization that the courses can be of similar designed varied by level and application context. SASI may provide new awareness for our instructional designers when they create statistic courses.

In many ways  they area good resource if other technology is not available. I have also had students measure diameter vs circumference of various circles and enter that data into one of four computers into the Logger-Pro program from Vernier. Trouble is the limited use of these computers causes students to rush through the examples and miss the point of y intercept  slope  SDV  variance  and correlation without getting the full meaning. Paige also has a good point about the TI84 being allowed on the AP tests. Why learn new technology you cannot use vs becoming a master at what you can? The Z80 in the TI84 is powerful although graphs are hard to read in great detail without taking the time to zoom. However  I have really enjoyed visiting the new resource shown to us in this course that I did not know existed. Census a School  TUVA and Gapminder being the most impressive for me at this time.

I've also used some of the free StatKey web tools.    I feel like there is a lot of power in being able to manipulate data in Excel outside of statistics  but am also not sure how to balance time spent learning a tool vs. time spent learning concepts (although I know these ideally can reinforce each other - but there is some \""start up cost\"" to getting students comfortable with a new tool).

I find students have a hard time with excel as much \hand\"" work is needed to make sense of data. Still  it is something they will have to do in a real setting  however  a larger organization will likely own more productive applications for use. I found the Stat Crunch and TUVA great resources. I would even consider census_at_school from week 1 materials and the AgainstAllOdds program from week 5 material. This latter series of videos and materials I found outstanding and something I could use out of the box to start a Stats course at the HS level. One another note  I have just attended a few TI Webinars and share your feelings. However  in my present low-tech environment  this would be the best technology I could hope students could use to manipulate data. There is much I cannot do on the TI calcs but the basics are possible where students enter data and can correlate graphs and do basic analysis.

I have used TI-84 product often and students are required to have them but less than half actually do. As a result  I also use a TI-83 version on my IWB where students can come up to the board to use the image of a TI83 with all its functionality or I can demo processes where students with calcs follow along and are paired up with students without the technology. I often have them work in pairs where the one with the calc shares data with those without as they write out their work on dry-erase boards and compare answers across the class.   Another APP I have used comes from Vernier. Being a physics teacher  I have used some of their sensors to have students do simple labs where they manipulate the data in the Vernier data analysis apps. I prefer this method but this only works when I get my hands on 4 old laptops I occasionally have available. I usually start the year with students developing skills by measuring various size circles and devising a graph of meaningful data to present to the class. I often have to guide students to graph circumference to diameter and we discuss slope and intercepts. I am looking forward to extending this lab to include statistical analysis as well.

Being my students would only have  access to excel  I used that program to download data into. The first problem  my students will have is to find the data they want to analyze.       For instance  there are four locations to look at before  considering the affect location may have on measurements. Are these representative  of a larger area or affected by geographical features? After students download  the data  this would require their becoming familiar with the data and a  discussion asking many questions. This would be good for developing ‚Äúhabits of  mind‚Äù but may be overwhelming if care is not taken to allow them time to discern  the possibilities.       Second  the amount of data requires a lot of work when using  Excel. Most students have only used small bits of data to make graphs if at  all. Now they have to move large bits of information which they should be able  to graph with little direction. However  this brings up new problems as their  initial graphs were I made very busy and would not make sense to many. For instance  a  dot plot of all the data from say one location for a graph of ozone on primary  axis and nitrogen on secondary access by location shows a comparison of these  two variables by location. The graph is very busy and I don not think my  students would think of breaking down the location data by finding the means  for each month and plotting those to simplify and communicate any possible  relationships. Making such a graph will show a trend (using linear regression) that  most will think as a means to an end. They would see a slight increase  over the period measured and incorrectly make connections to global warming and  would tend to end their motivation for further investigation there. My  challenge question to myself is ‚Äúhow to keep students engaged with the bigger  ideas behind the data and not get overwhelmed?‚Äù      What I anticipate is much confusion  initially  and keeping  students motivated in higher thinking will be my greatest challenge. Second  finding  another data analysis program besides Excel and the necessary technology would  be equally problematic. I would consider TUVA before Census at School and the tools supplied would be a  better choice if the we have access to the technology.  Lastly  time for implementation of such  lessons may be greater than I am allowed; I need to find some way to integrate  many standards into each lesson that follow existing course objectives.

Working with real data sets that are complex  involve multiple variables  are messy  etc. is time consuming  challenging  but also extremely rewarding for students. I think one of the tricks is thinking about what is your student learning objective for the activity and where does it fall within the semester/year of the course. If you want students to engage in the authentic process of working with a complete  large-scale authentic data set then keeping it as is for the students is important. However  if you want them to practice comparing multiple variables across two populations  then you can use the real data but in a format that would more quickly help the students get to that objective (aka remove some of the other variables  reduce the size of the data set  do some initial data processing to clean it up  etc.). Similarly  if you are using the data set towards the beginning of your class I would imagine you may want to provide more support  either through doing some initial processing of the dataset they use and/or through check in points during the activity  then you would need to provide towards the end of the class.  All to say  I empathize and agree with the points that you have made. I just also am supporting and cheerleading you to keep working out how best to include such a rich opportunity for your students into your class.  Good luck.

It is so true that I need to get beyond the \cook book\"" and set a more positive goal for myself when I teach a statistics chapter in algebra.  I am often afraid of doing things wrong and making sure there is a correct answer.  I will remember your comment \""if it feels more like a math course than a science course  you're doing it wrong\"" every year I try to improve this chapter for my algebra students.  All of these lessons and resources for the class have been super helpful.  I feel it might be more about the discussions about data than an answer for my students!  I am excited to try it all out next year!  """

I used the software in teaching Technology for the Elementary Teacher.  It was very easy for the students to learn how to use by using the CAT Task.  They immediately posed questions  used the visuals to draw conclusions.  With just this one task  they were easily able to import a dataset from Field Trip Earth on the NC Zoo site and analyze bear data.  There are several resources on line with gr. 4-8 lessons for Tinkerplots.

However  one thing I kept thinking about throughout the videos and resources was the presumption that students could easily analyze the data in a table or graphical representation and then interpret their results within in the context of their question. Technology helps us get our students to this step faster  as Webster pointed out in the panel  but it left me thinking are we leaving some of our students behind as we presume they can effectively read the data representation? There are many steps involved in reading a data visualization and being able to engage with the data to the extent that we are discussing  especially at level C  here. As experts that are comfortable looking at data  we see it differently than novices that are still building their skills in engaging with data in a visualization.  I am curious what kinds of tasks/activities/discussion prompts/tools folks have used successfully to scaffold this aspect of getting students to interact with and make sense of the data visualization enough that they can be successful in the Analyze and Interpret phases.

It does take time  but you will be so much happier with the outcome to let them collect the data and then manipulate the data in ways that make them feel like they own it and want to figure it out.  Also  when you don't get clean data  it's even better because it really sparks neat discussions among your students and sparks the discovery learning!  Good luck!

It's so hard to find time to spend a good amount of time on a statistics lesson or unit when it isn't the core of the course you are teaching. Example: I teach Honors Algebra 2 with Trig... emphasis on alg 2 during 1st semester and trig 2nd semester.  When time doesn't allow for a full lesson or unit  I think it's best to at least get the students thinking more deeply in terms of analysis. Some of my students in honors aren't always the natural deeper thinkers. Getting them out of their comfort zones and practicing error analysis or explaining their reasoning is huge! Anything to get them to think about their thinking! :)

There are opportunities for data analysis each time a new parent function is studied.  Finding best-fit curves allows us to discuss center and spread of each variable and how they work together to produce the best-fit curve.  It gives us the chance to work within a context  discuss issues of measurement  and have the conversation with students about expecting variability.

My job in my district prior to taking leave was in Elementary Mathematics Curriculum and professional development and prior to that a Middle School Mathematics teacher.  This MOOC was very insightful to me as I read through posts  watched videos  and looked at data and thought about the change of how we teach statistics especially since I began teaching even in 1999.  I am wondering if there are any other elementary educators in this MOOC.  I am so concerned for the lack of statistics in the curriculum.  It is very alarming.  I remember being shocked and disappointed when so much was removed as we began following Common Core and after going through this MOOC  I am scared of the disservice we are doing to our students.  To hope that teachers will teach it anyway  well  its a hope.  Its not being tested and the curriculum is so deep and students are struggling on tested curriculum.  They will not (and understandably) given high stakes  put time into an area that the Common Core doesn't emphasize at all in their grade.

In fact we are being encouraged to take workshops about statistics  because we need to focus on it more.  Our current Freshman algebra students know how to find the mean  median  and mode  but they are not good at interpreting what is the best measure of center.  I think that this course will help me clarify these ideas more  but I feel like we have to spend more time developing the statistical thinking involved  not just the calculations (those are not the tough part).  I think that the focus needs to shift to the process: pose  collect  analyze  interpret .... and this should happen at all levels.

That leaves one of two extremes: (1) a cursory exploration of stats within other math courses  or (2) AP Statistics. To counter this  our school is trying a non-AP stats course this year. It will be a great opportunity for us to develop statistical skills  habits of mind  and comfort with handling the uncertainty inherent with statistics.

However  I have used videos with similar results in physics and may think of applying this to students in stats. Funny  but I thought the girl-driven videos showed most evidence of applying stats. I wonder if there is an stats project here...However  I feel there are many courses students should take before Calculus as a calculus teacher because the number of holes I find students have in basic math understanding are a constant frustration of mine. At the high school level  this course MOOC has strengthened my convictions that other courses should come first (including stats  thanks to Dr. Benjamin in part). The overall trouble I have with the videos is that they would have to be done outside of class and my cadets have very little time or resources to collaborate on such a project. I did use this method as a project idea when in the Public School system with physics students with similar results. The guys seemed to lack focus of the main objectives. None the less  the students enjoyed the project and there were some great videos  but once again  mostly from the girls. Word of caution though  control must be exerted from the teacher into the content the students used and all videos should be viewed in a public forum in my opinion. Copyright issues are real as most will post their work to social media.

I give my strongest recommendation to the Against All Odds series on Learner.org.  They're narrated by Pardis Sabeti - a Harvard Computational Biologist.  I mention them because those videos can serves as a framework for what you want your students to do.  \Here are some professionally done videos.  What are some common approaches used to convey the ideas powerfully and thoroughly?\""  I actually had a group this year do a video dressed as and impersonating Pardis Sabeti and she liked it so much she posted it on her twitter feed.  (Besides being brilliant  she's also an extremely cool and interesting person.)  In other words  it's a good way to convey to kids  \""The medium isn't the thing  it's how the medium is used.\""  That being said  I don't limit or constrain how they do their videos.  I've seen unbelievable rap videos made by these kids that I will forever treasure.     """

The reason is for students to experience less than perfect data. In cleaning the data  the students will need to use critical thinking. The critical thinking will be to determine the breadth of the research and also the limits. I will be using the video that young students ponder their decisions. I believe this will be worthwhile as it represents a real world situation.   The data will then be used to learn and interpret descriptive statistics. I will demonstrate inferential statistics at course end.   Other thoughts?

It seems like the \right\"" way to teach stats. However  AP Stats has a very specific focus with their curriculum  It doesn't have them pose questions  it definitely doesn't have them collect their own data (or deal with messy  real world data)  and it relies only on the calculator for all technology. The instructor at the AP training I went to even said kids will never enter their own data for the exam  so you may consider this when teaching.  Has anyone been successful in teaching AP stats using other software along with the calculators and really promoting the investigative process in the way you teach? If so  please share everything you can!    """

The more voices  the more we can learn together!       We hope that you have found some of the ideas  free resources  and tech tools to be engaging and can see the potential for use in your practice. For example  one <strong>free resource</strong> is the assessment items in the Unit 1 Investigation. By engaging you with these items  we hoped you could begin to imagine how to assess <em>conceptual understanding</em> in statistics. You could register for your own LOCUS account <a href=\""https://locus.statisticseducation.org/\"" target=\""_blank\"">at their website</a> and use some of the many assessments offered in your own classrooms. Their website also has many <a href=\""https://locus.statisticseducation.org/professional-development\"" target=\""_blank\"">sample items</a> on the public pages (no account needed) where you can examine items  read about how an item assesses different standards  and see how students typically perform on an item. We can learn so much about statistics teaching by examining good assessments and how students think on these.      Don't forget to check out these elements of the course:   	  	<ul>  		<li><strong>Engage with Essentials</strong> includes core readings  frameworks  and videos.</li>  		<li><strong>Dive Into Data</strong> gives you great opportunities to examine new data tools!</li>  		<li><strong>Learn from the Experts</strong> highlights  critical discussions among experts in statistics education.</li>  		<li><strong>Investigations</strong> get you active in doing and discussing activities aimed to help you develop your skills as a teacher of statistics.</li>  		<li><strong>Discuss with Your Colleagues</strong> lets you take the wheel and drive the conversations to discuss important ideas you are learning and wanting to engage with colleagues about. For example  in Unit 2  I posted a discussion topic to get us talking about using multivariable data sets to think about the design of worthwhile statistical tasks. <a href=\""https://place.fi.ncsu.edu/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=13716#p36848\"" target=\""_blank\"">Join the conversation</a>!</li>  		<li>After Unit 2  you may be ready to start to <strong>Demonstrate Your Learning</strong> by submitting responses to earn a micro-credential and badge to show your teaching statistics power!</li>  	</ul>     If you have not discovered this already  you can check off the gray boxes on the <a href=\""https://place.fi.ncsu.edu/course/view.php?id=52\"" target=\""_blank\"">Course Home page</a> to help you keep track of pages you have completed!

Before taking this assessment  I would have said my students were very prepared for such an assessment.  But I struggled with this.  As I read through the reasoning afterward  the real answers make sense  but I got three of them wrong.  A couple of my students would fair better than I did  but most of them would get at least the ones I got wrong because I haven't prepared them well.  I love these questions despite my inability to determine the right answers.  They stimulate critical thinking and force students to analyze the problem and their statistical knowledge and formulate the valid response.  I need to better equip my students; I think this will be done as I grow in my understanding of statistics.  I love these questions and plan to use them in my classroom.  They will challenge my students greatly  but help them grow as learners  problem solvers  and critical thinkers.

As you look through the PDF that has the explanations in them  notice that some of the questions are labeled as a Level A or Level B.  These would be most applicable to middle school students.  If you go and look at the LOCUS website to see more items  be sure to look for ones labels Level A or B.

Nevertheless  I find that even strong readers with a good vocabulary still struggle with word problems...this is something I am always interesting in investigating.  Just from my observations  it seems that my stronger readers are used to looking for a gestalt or main idea in what they read  and less skilled at the kind of close  nuanced reading required by word problems (of any kind  but these more than most).  Often they cannot readily explain the differences between answer choices  differences that might hinge on one word (like \cause\"" in the lifestyle study problem) or even a preposition.  With my (mostly native English speaking) students  this seems to be the specific \""reading\"" weakness that comes up in word problems  frequently along with and inextricable from their weaknesses in number and operation sense.  Does anyone know of good research on the topic of what factors cause students to struggle with word problems? """

I work with mostly Tier 2 students. I had to read the questions several times myself and reason out the answers. I can see many of my students having trouble with this task.

We teach a statistics unit at the end of the year. During freshman year we teach how to construct a box and whiskers plot but I think many of the students would not remember how to interpret the data from it. We do not teach how to find a p value so my students would not be able to answer this question. Some students would have difficulty reasoning through the different examples. I think we need to give our students more of these problems and allow for time to discuss the answers.

I explained the questions to her as I went along. All of the questions make sense once explained - even to an eight year old. But I agree with you that most students would struggle with these on their own. That's why classroom discussion is valuable  I believe (even at the college level where I am). Reasoning through these together - perhaps taking each option on a case by case basis and exploring why it may or may not be correct - is key.

We cover all of these topics in our intro stats course  but many students would struggle with these questions even at the end of the semester  I'm afraid. It seems as though the curriculum I teach from is geared toward getting students ready as soon as possible for hypothesis testing and confidence intervals. We cover LOTS of broad concepts and definitions during the first month or so of class. After that  we are focused on the <i>z </i>and <i>t-</i>tables (and a little bit on regression). I think we should focus a little more on broad statistical reasoning - along with the nuts and bolts of calculations.

It's such a struggle to teach them the material that I think they are missing the actual concepts.  I  definitely need to focus more on teaching them the statistical reasoning that goes along with these type of questions.

I have been teaching this course for several years now. I can say that most of my students will have a hard time answering these questions. They have knowledge of the topics including in the 8 questions. However  the way the question is worded may not be easy for some of my students to interpret. I have noticed also that my students read statistics questions as if they are reading math. They focus on the numbers in the questions  rather than getting the meaning of the terms. As I teach this class more  I try to use technology for calculations and focus in interpreting the result.  It is give and take at the level of my students. This exercise helped me in the way of framing questions.

Our   department disagrees with the extra credit concept since it is so  elementary.  Although I agree with the department  I sometimes wonder   (since we cover so many broad concepts in STATs) whether extra credit   might be used to encourage the students to further investigate and   grapple with mass data‚Äã.

Some of this is not necessarily conceptual (a lot of them have never seen a box and whiskers plot before). As an faculty member what I like about the LOCUS is that it forces me to think about how to help students really understand what the results of data analysis mean.

This MOOC has made me realize I have not been focusing enough on fostering students' statistical habits of mind. Thankfully  I believe I now have a framework from which to develop assessments and integrate new course objectives involving these concepts.

To me it is also hard to continually write new assessment questions that get at the concepts that we want them to get. It is easy to write the calculation questions  but harder to write good concept questions.

One where the students know almost nothing about statistics besides mean  median  and mode (but for the most part  don't remember how to compute/figure out any of them) and are expected to take an AP course (seniors); And another in which the students are exposed to some statistical topics  but the concepts are generally taught at the end of the year and sometimes are rushed.  The first group would probably be able to handle most  if not all  of the questions by the end of the year  but the second (freshmen) would probably struggle on the majority of them.   Part of the struggle for both groups  is getting through the wording of the question and spending the time to really try to understand what information is provided and what conclusions they can draw from that information.  I think something that could really benefit students is giving them group tasks in which they can explore data  see how it looks in different forms  and discuss what outcomes can and cannot be drawn from the data.  The more discussion about  and interaction with data  the better they will start to understand how to analyze a data set.

I agree with you  and many others who pointed this out in other posts  that conceptual-based questions require thoughtful reading skills and the ability to parse through all the information.    I love your suggestion that engaging students more with data explorations as they work in groups could really help them develop some of the needed conceptual understanding!  I think you will get LOTS of great ideas for implementing this strategy in this course!

Many of our students (and I see many others as well) struggle with these problems and not necessarily with the math  but with the reading. For some it is remembering what \at least\"" means whereas some would struggle with understanding or visually seeing what each answer is trying to present (i.e. comparing the different answers in the running shoe question). I know I have moved towards using technology to do the calculations so that I can focus more on the interpretation  but I'm not sure that would be enough to make students do very well on this.   I wonder how many of these reading issues stem from many students trying to get through assignments or tests as quickly as possible? I know I mention it some  but I think I need to start emphasizing to students how businesses  the medical community  politicians  and others make decisions like these questions everyday and that their decision (or the student's one day) could affect how other people live their lives.

But I completely agree with you that students would most likely struggle with language. Some because they simply don't understand the situation by just reading it  others because they will not carefully read the questions but look for a similar look of a question and then right dive into it.

I find a lot of authentic statistical situations to be at a pretty high reading level  which can really make them challenging for students (especially international students!)  I do think it is super important though that students are challenged and start to learn that technical writing is very different from creative writing.

I spend so much time just tying to get them to understand the broad concepts and learning the z &amp; t charts  that I think they (and I ) lose the nuances of what we're really trying to focus on.  I definitely think I need to reconsider how I approach the material with them.  In order to help them learn these concepts better  I think I need to have more conceptual type examples to promote more class discussions.  I like the idea of putting a question on the board and having them discuss it in groups  come up with an answer. After  they could compare answers and discuss which answer is best.  This is definitely something for me as an instructor to improve upon.

To prepare my students for these type of questions  I would need to make sure I have covered the basics such as types of data collections  difference between experiments and observations  as well as what a p-value can tell us.  I thing using a more hands-on approach with my students would help them understand and retain the information better.  I loved the gapider world website.  I think that would be very useful in a stats course.

I loved the Gapminder website. I am thinking of ways to incorporate that into this semester.   I have a question for you. When students have the basics covered  do you think it is naturally intuitive for them to analyze data correctly or do you think we(teachers) have to also teach them how to reason? I've been debating with myself about this.

I think many times my Intro to Stats students think they are in a math class and just focus on the numbers and forget to focus on the heart of the problem. I like to start off my Stats class by saying this is not a typical math class. You will be doing a lot of reading and researching.   The Intro to Stats students that I work with on a daily basis are not as prepared as I would like them to be to answer the items in the investigation. I think this comes from a lack of critical thinking abilities  a lack of reading abilities  and a rush to finish assignments.  I believe I flipped-class approach along with articles  globalized projects  and data investigations would prepare my students to answer these types of questions. I think it would be crucial to start day one of the class with some kind of activity or investigation to do so.

I also think that starting day 1 with an investigation would be great for setting the tone and letting them dive in!  I think as you go through the units  you will see lots of activities and can think about which one would work well in your context that would have low floor (easy entry) and high ceiling (lots of room for students to show what they know how to do). Let's keep this idea of a starting activity going throughout the unit discussions!

Interpretation of the numbers is just a small part of the process of statistics.  We have technology that will find the mean  create a box-plot  and assess significance.  The \preparation\"" work of statistics is often more involved.  What is an appropriate question to ask?  What types of data will I need to answer this question?  How do I collect data that is representative of the population I am considering?  These are questions that I did not spend enough time with when I was teaching.  More often than not  I provided a data set and asked then to \""crunch a number\""... Which in retrospect is not really the point of statistics.   """

I want them to SEE what statistics is  not just have them listen to me explain what it is.  And I agree with you that careful reading and interpretation can be as big a part of statistics (and answering multiple choice questions) as calculation.  Rumor has it that students usually do worse on MC part of the AP exam than the Free Response part  and I do believe that is due to a couple of reasons...1) test writers being so good at writing answers students think will be correct (based on common misconceptions) and 2) lack of careful reading.  The more practice students can get with this  the better!

When I first started teaching statistics I completely ignored the statistical investigatory process  never touching on forming statistical questions or designing studies. All of my focus was on analyzing data. Now I do much more with the entire process  particularly due to my teaching Advanced Placement Statistics which necessitated this.

Sometimes as teachers we get so bogged down with all the things we need to do  we forget about what we are doing. I know that has nothing to do with stats  but it is important. I don't teach statistics  but I do teach science. I want my students to be able to read graphs and understand what they are observing.

As I reflected on this question  I began to realize how much of the process of statistics is dependent on meticulous planning and careful execution.  In reality  things like the creation of a box plot or histogram  or finding the mean in a data set are relatively simple  quick tasks.  It is much more time consuming to develop a hypothesis  decide on relevant data to collect  and devise a plan for gathering that data.  I don't know that we do that good a job in the k - 12 curriculum on that part.  We ask students to interpret  but not necessarily design an investigation.  Anyway... I thought your comment on speed was interesting.  Statistics is a slow and involved process.  We want it to be a slow process because we are dealing with uncertainty.  We need to assess statistics slowly and deliberately in order to be sure we are making the best decisions possible.  """

Previously  I taught high school  (from '02 - '08) in a variety of settings.  Much of my experience was working with vocational high school students in a suburban setting.  Thinking back on the 8 questions that we just answered  I would be surprised if there were any questions in that set that were consistently answered correctly by my students.  While statistics was part of the curriculum  we tended to spend less time focusing in this area than in other areas as we felt the state assessment (which is a graduation requirement in Massachusetts) emphasized other areas.     The one question that might have been more likely to have been answered correctly is the one that dealt with the box plot.  This was the only visual representation that we covered well in our curriculum.  Some of the other questions were just not even considered.  For instance the question about significance and p-values would not have been addressed at all.    The more interesting questions were the survey design questions.  I am unclear about how my students would do on a question like the \light shoe\"" question or the \""health survey\"" question.  I probably made unreasonable assumptions about students' ability to collect representative data and answer appropriate questions.    """

There's the heavy mathematical approach where you focus on producing calculations and interpreting slightly at the end. There's the analytical approach where you might skim over the mathematical/graphical production approach  and focus on interpretations and analysis. For my students  I think I have been focusing more on the production of said calculations and graphs  and not as much on the latter. If there's only so much time in a class period  how can I do both? Give them the foundational material  AND make sure they understand it conceptually. This is an interesting problem for me to think about.   I would like to think that my students would do well since they know how to create these graphs and interpret the basic results. Maybe I will try some this week and see.

As a pre-tenured faculty member  I was one of the only statisticians in the math department.  The textbook already chosen for the intro stats course was written from a mathematical point of view and favored a formula-driven and probably approach.  Transitioning the course to focus more on statistical literacy and critical thinking didn't get a lot of buy-in at first.  (e.g.  Why would an exam in statistics contain so many WORDS and why do the answers look like essays??)   I think math departments embrace statistics and its applied nature these days.  I liked the remark by one of the speakers on the expert panel that teaching statistics helps make mathematics real-world to students.  It's interesting that math majors aren't always the better students in an intro stats course.  The eight multiple choice questions were hard enough that I had to re-read and dig in before answering them.

I  struggle with how to intertwine the two without losing the students. They seem to want to compartmentalize the two instead of looking at them as two parts of a whole  though that could be more due to my lack of experience.   I also would like to think that many of my students would do well. I could see them not doing well because of the differences in question presentation  though. I don't give tests in the traditional sense  so this question format might be a little foreign.

I am sure others have similar stories and we may be able to help each other make those transitions easier and more powerful in departments. I think this issue within a college setting also shows up at the high school level within mathematics departments. There may only be one course in statistics  but many of the courses have substantial units on statistics...so all the math teachers have to think about how to make math and statistics teaching complement each other.  I like the point about the textbook....what textbooks do folks suggest that seem to align with treating statistics as a data-intensive endeavor that involves investigations?

Students (at all levels) will rush to finish their work fast and many do not take the time to read instructions carefully. I have seen this with K-12 as well as my college students.  One way  maybe  could be to have students watch videos and giving them different options to deliver their answer. Some will select video or charts/graphs... then a great group discussion would could be centered on what type of delivery is more effective.   Perseverance has to do with the productive disposition of the students and I think that many of our tasks are perceived as boring. It is up to us to make the problems students solve interesting  relevant  and important to them. We can only do this by getting to know our students. Teaching is very involved  indeed.

This isn't a good strategy in a stats class because word choice can really change the response.  Take your time - are there subtle differences?  They don't always take my advice. """

In both of the classes I teach that include statistics content  students are introduced to concepts. In one course they are introduced to how to consume statistical reports. More specifically  how to analyze those reports. 8 categories are presented for doing the analysis.    The statistics textbook immediately starts with the process of gathering and classifying data.       My perception is that it is better to start with the consuming statistical information in a colloquial sense. Then future discussions can be used to modify their intuition or to confirm it. Build on what they know.        Given this approach  most students could not answer the first set of questions at the beginning of a course. As their skills build  they would be better equipped to digest the material.

So the question is more about familiarity with the concepts of p value and statistical significance  careful reading (recognizing that the problem says the results are statistically significant)  and the fluency to recognize that two of the results are too large to be called statistically significant  than about calculation.

Then  about half way through semester 1 I started basic statistics to build out the idea of variables  level of measurement  univariate statistics.  Then I really talked about hypotheses and  looked at bivariate analysis.  Then with sampling  in the methods text we could link up with hypothesis testing in the statistics book.  Also we had the General Social Survey in both books  but it did give us the chance to really talk about survey research.  If I remember correctly we probably did qualitative methods toward the end of the year.  Now I think I would do it differently  but I do think it is a good idea.  I've been thinking a lot about how to rethink this division in our department. For example  maybe it would make sense to put survey research as a method in the \statistics\"" class and we already do practical sampling in the methods class so I don't feel the need to cover more than simple random sampling in statistics.

First I want to say that the level at which some topics were covered when I started is vastly different from what I teach today.  My students from years gone by would have done rather poorly on the several of the questions presented.  Not that my current students would do great but there are definitely some question that I would expect some pretty good results.  But there are also a couple of questions that I am afraid the responses would not be so impressive.  I know statistical reasoning is something I should concentrate more on with my students but I feel like I can hardly get the current material covered in the short time I have with them.  Using technology has definitely allowed for more time to cover more material but the additional time seems to have been consumed with added content.

I have a higher percentage of students who stay on task and complete an assignment when the amount of thinking is minimal and is simply \kill and drill\"" because that's what they are used to doing.  One of the challenges I have in my classes is to undo this mindest by providing them with richer tasks and challenging questions that measure understanding instead of fluency with a skill.  I don't always do this correctly  though.  I know it is something I need to do  but I struggle with implementing it in a way that gets student buy-in.  Most of these questions would not be successful for my students because it isn't just a plug-in style question  but I feel like these are the questions that our students really need to be able to perform well on in order to demonstrate an actual understanding of statistics.  I need to spend more time having students evaluate studies  discuss issues with data collection  and explore items instead of just teach them how to get an answer.  I believe that a more activity-driven statistics classroom would provide students with more opportunities to discuss and deepen their understandings and be able to answer these questions correctly.

I am currently teaching in a kinder class  so statistics is something that has not been brought up at all yet (we are still learning the names of the numbers) but I can see running in to this problem with students in my future as an educator. Even now as an adult  I want to be provided with the formula or the way to get to the answer faster. But that is simply not how it works. I believe in implementing as much activity-driven lessons that will guide the students to think more on their own and learn how to get to the answer of a problem with out being given the formula/way to achieve the answer. I am sure that this is something that will come easier and more efficiently to us as teachers  the more years  trials  and examples we see and how we teach.

Not all of my students are strong readers and strategic test-takers  but many are.  We've covered most of these topics by this point in the year and I saw similarities in a few of them to the questions I give on chapter tests.  I think the only one not covered yet is p-value  but many of my students have a general sense of what it is because of the work done in their biology courses.

Both sets of students would not be well prepared to answer the items in this investigation given the limited amount skills they have developed in their math and statistics courses about how to think statistically. I can assist the students I tutor by using tools like Gapminder to get them to engage with real data sets and help them start thinking about statistics questions that can be looked at. For my peers in education  I have realized that I need to figure out how to approach the topic of statistics with them in a way that doesn't have them feeling frustrated and angry. Many of my peers have taken many quantitative courses but have not had the opportunity to explore statistics through data investigations. Using LOCUS assessments and Gapminder as well as other data investigation resources  I hope to expose my peers to different ways of learning about statistics so that they can develop a better appreciation for the need to teach future educators in math and science about statistical thinking.

History has always been challenging for me to keep track of  and as I watched the progression of circles  I found myself trying hard to connect my historical knowledge with the patterns I saw  and I kept thinking of more and more questions: why was the correlation between income and life expectancy more dramatic in certain decades than others - were there new innovations only available to the rich?  Is it easier to increase life expectancy when it starts low  than when it is already high?  Why is it that in 2015 it takes a large increase in income to obtain a small increase in life expectancy?  And why is the Civil War the only significant \war blip\"" in the US legacy?  As a person who loves numbers  this brings history to life for me  in a way. """

I have been struggling with how to reconcile the expectations that students will know about p values with the reality that they can be misused and aren't even appropriate for most samples.  So what I've more or less come around to is using StatKey to focus much more on the idea of sampling distribution  illustrating the idea that most randomly selected samples will be pretty good  but a few will be really bad and we never will know which one we have when doing research in the real world.  And if we aren't using some kind of random sampling we really don't have much ability to even say what the probability of  anything.  I think that really getting that is more important than the formula for a p value.

They don't have to know as many formulas  but need to understand when it is acceptable to make certain calculations and then how to interpret these big ideas.  The $100 machine in their hands does the other work for them!    It also took a few years of teaching statistics  but I find myself tying pvalue into many concepts earlier in the year.  It naturally comes up in discussions about probability and simulation.  What's the chance of our result occurring?  Is that a reasonable chance or are we suspicious that something else is at play?

As a parent of elementary kids  i love to hear opportunities for them to make sense of data---and I particularly like how you are thinking about connecting these with science standards!  Within the math curriculum  there are also rich opportunities to gather data related to the Measurement standards.... imagine as they are learning about measuring in inches and cm if they all have to measure the same object (say the teacher's arm span) in inches and then again in cm.  plotting those on different dot plots....a great opportunity to talk about what may have contributed to so many different values in their measurements and which measurement unit seems to lead to less variability.

It is literally the first thing we do  and I use it as a baseline for a lot of things.  The project is to gather the average temperature for a 7-day period in two places: their hometown (the program is a sleepaway camp and many of them come from far away) and their favorite city.  They then make a poster displaying their results and briefly present it to the class.  This allows for the teacher to see where students are at with graphing (what display will they choose  how they will interpret it  etc) as well as the sophistication of their comparison of two sets of data.  Also to assess their English language ability (many of them are from other countries) and their comfort level speaking in front of their peers.  It gives a great basis for where we need to go from here in many different areas!

I think it has made an impact on the way that I think of statistics as compares with other mathematical domains.  I really lie the way that he discussed statistics as a way of dealing with uncertainty.  I don't think I had ever really thought of stats like this before.     My undergraduate degree was in anthropology and I concentrated in New England archaeology (pre-Columbian).  Everything that we discovered as archaeologists was presumably a sample of a larger population of items.  In retrospect  we utilized statistical techniques to deal with the uncertainty of what we might have missed.  It is not feasible to expect that we could discover and excavate entire populations of items  so we had to extrapolate in order to be able to tell reasonable stories about the past.  While we can never be certain about the events that occurred in a particular place at a particular time  we can employ careful data collection techniques to minimize some of the uncertainty that is bound to exist...  The other part of the Shaughnessy article that I appreciated was it's reference to the idea of \fairness\"".  From a social justice point-of-view  statistics can be a powerful lens to help students discover  and potentially act on  issues of inequity and injustice in the world.  In so much as the goal of education is to develop responsible citizens in a democratic society  encouraging the responsible use of statistics is essential.  This view of statistics adds a moral element to mathematics that we don't often think about.  Certainly  I think  students don't think this way.  I suspect they view mathematics mostly as a neutral topic devoid of issues like politics  religion  gender  etc...  It is a nice reminder of the social power of mathematics.    """

However  I often find it difficult to find enough time to suggest multiple applications for each topic.  I think this is because of a very dense curriculum for the statistics class I teach at the undergraduate level.  Moreover  though students have a pre-requisite for my class  I have found that I can't count on them understanding the ideas of that class when they begin mine.  As such  I feel that I'm often just trying to find enough time to explain everything I'm supposed to cover.

For example  I have shown the Hans Rosling TED talk  but not used Gapminder for any projects just yet (so many cool things and so little time).  I also debate about which technologies to use with my students and need to make some time to investigate StatCrunch and all it has to offer.   One of my favorite questions posed was from the panel about how much data a person generates and what happens with that data.  I would love to pose that question to my students!  Some of the cool articles and/or videos I've used to get my students thinking include Malcolm Gladwell's TED talk about spaghetti sauce (and every one of his books)  and article about Target being able to market a teenage girl because they realized she was pregnant before she had a chance to share the news at home  Ester Duflo's TED talk about using Social Experiments to Fight Poverty  and Peter Donnelly's TED talk How Stat Fool Juries which deals with probability misconceptions.  I obviously love TED talks.  I also love to make class sets of current news articles to distribute to my students.  I often use them as a warm-up while checking homework and there are no points assigned.  There aren't even always specific questions asked.  I keep reminding them that I want them to be aware of how much statistics they will encounter in their daily lives.  It's important for them to understand what is being presented and to question it!    I just mentioned the book Innumeracy by John Allen Paulos in class the other day.  I've used that as an assignment (give responses to ideas presented in each chapter) and regularly have students comment about when the book was written.  They can't believe how relevant (sadly) it still is.  For those who were nervous or intimidated to start this course  you took the right first step in starting.  The more you immerse yourself in the daily examples of statistics  the easier it will be for you to pose these interesting and relevant problems to your students.

If I were to pick the most worthwhile for engaging students in statistics structurally  I would say the Old Faithful example.   The Old Faithful task incorporates probability into statistics  requires critical thinking  utilizes group discussion  as well as asking students to determine the right data graph and defend their choice which is essential.  But I also think that the Television Time task would be more worthwhile for engaging students topically because it is something that has to do with them.  In my experience if the activity has a direct impact or revolves around the students' lives  they are more actively engaged.  The Television Time task effectively brings ownership of students which is important and students could be collecting the data  but the task itself needs more depth in order to fully engage students and develop their true understanding of statistics.  For example  students were not given the opportunity to choose which graphical representation to use and the questions are very surface questions rather than providing opportunities for uncertainty.

Personally  I would have done the Old Faithful because I have been there and counted the time between eruptions.  However  students would find the television one more engaging and fun because it does apply to them.  If I was to rewrite this assignment  I might have our class interview or poll each other about the amount of time we spend watching t.v.  As a class  we would plot our data.  Then  I would find another class to interview  either next door or Skype some international class.  We would plot their data and then compare.  I like this assignment because it was not only visual  but provided critical thinking to sort through the data and how the designer plotted the graph.  Thanks for sharing   Eren

For a supplemental exercise(s)  we could ask students    1) how much difference there may be between their estimate of their TV viewing time and their actual/true TV viewing time;  2) if they would be more comfortable giving a range of values for their viewing time;  3) if they think that making up categories (e.g.  0 to less than 3 hours  3 to less than 6 hours  etc.) would be \better\""  plus how would they determine the ranges for categories.

For the Middle School Tasks:  Task1: Airport Passengers - I was wondering why the students were instructed to make a dot plot with the data. Wouldn't another type of graph be more appropriate for this data like a histogram? Why would middle school students care about this problem? This is a typical textbook problem. It does not involve the students with the data. What is the purpose of asking these questions? In part b - why ask how many airports have approximately 25 million passengers? There should be a point to these questions.  Task 2: The Old Faithful - This is a more involved problem. Students need to make two different graphs and decide which graph best represents the data. Students are asked \to wonder\"" and come up with questions the data set might answer. Students can work with the data given. They can see a purpose to the questions asked. The investigation has some meaning for them.  Task 3 - Television Time - I feel more could be don with this problem. The students could discuss the two questions in class but why not have the students collect their own data? This would make the question more relevant to the students. This is a typical text book question. It does not involve the students with the data. I do not think most students would care about this problem or the results. What is the purpose of the asking these questions?     High School Task 1 - Car Weight and Milage  This problem gives students data to manipulate to apply to a formula. This is a typical textbook question that is good for getting students familiar with manipulating the data and the formulas. Some students might be interested in this but more discussion would be needed on how the data was gathered.   Task 2 - Pepsi vs. Coke Activity  This would be a fun activity for a class to do to learn how to set up a test and to use the information gathered in classroom work. This involves students collecting their own data and analyzing their own data. I would think the students would be find this problem relevant and could lead to other experiments in collecting data.  Task 3 - Television Time  This is a rather weak problem/question for high school students. Why ask this question? This seems rather simplistic and would not lead to much discussion in the classroom.

I love how you included a way to make the television task more relevant. As for the other  the airport task  I don't think students would benefit from this because they don't have an interest in airports yet.  My students are still dreaming of when they can take Driver's Education.  Old Faithful was my favorite of all!

I definitely thought the Old Faithful problem was the best in utilizing the POSE  COLLECT  ANALYZE  INTERPRET steps used in statistics.  The Television Time would be more relevant if students collect their own data.  The airport  passengers would not be something my students would relate to.

I think it would <i>really</i> engage students since EVERYONE has an opinion on the taste of Pepsi vs. Coke. I also think that the idea of confidence intervals is very worthwhile. This is a skill that is very helpful to understand how statistical sampling works.   I have a series of extra credit assignments that I give to my intro stats students. After a test  I take all of the test scores  scrub personal information  and then have the students  use their own data to demonstrate the topics we recently covered. For instance  after the chapter test on graphing and descriptive stats  I have the students create a box plots  histograms  and frequency distribution tables with their own data. After we discuss probability  I create a contingency table that breaks down letter grades and sex and have the students compute conditional probabilities  joint probabilities  and other basic items. The students really engage when the date are relevant to them.

As a side note  I began to run through all of the things that could go wrong with that investigation including but not limited to:  - breaking a rule of no food/drink in the classroom  - promotion of unhealthy food choices  - objection from parents who deny their child sugar  It made me a little sad that these were my first thoughts (and quite probably the thoughts that would determine whether I would use this task in my classroom).  All of the potential problems seem trivial to me  but are real objections that  if I were still teaching high school  would try to avoid.  Again  I am a little sad that the primary (or at least initial)  concerns that drives my instruction are related to placating administrators and parents  and not concern for the best task... :(

I was thinking it would be interesting to do a similar activity with data about how long people wait for the subway in our city  because I'm sure the city is collecting the data  and there are so many interesting questions that could be asked:  How early should you leave to be pretty sure you will arrive on time?  How do fluctuations in metro times affect commuters and the feasibility of certain commutes?  How does wait time for the metro affect its competition with other forms of transportation  such as Uber?       I think any of the tasks could be enriched with more context and exploration  but it's nice to have an activity like Old Faithful where it already stands as a pretty rich exploration without too much work on the teacher's part.

I am guessing there are things in every  community for which people need to wait. The question is if anyone is  collecting data about them and if that data is public. When I read  the Old Faithful task  I was thinking  ‚ÄúThis is great!

I had not really thought much about the relationship between these two variables (although I wonder how strong that relationship really is and if there are other factors involved).  The task forced me to think about what the coefficients meant and what the equation was doing.  That having been said  this was more of an algebra task than a statistics task.  The task might be strengthened by use of a larger batch of car weights and related MPG reports... or better yer  have students gather this data themselves.  The task gave the students the exact data that would have made it worthwhile as a statistical assignment  The television task had similar elements (although I found it trivial).  The context was weak and may or may not have been from real data (I suspect not).  Putting the issue of context and collection aside  I am not sure what the point was here.  This may have been a more reasonable task if it were being used to introduce the idea of graphical displays of data.  As i looked at the display  I immediately wished that I had the original data as this display of the data seemed inappropriate for the question (I would have used a back to back stem-and-leaf plot myself).  The Coke/Pepsi task was certainly the most engaging and best aligns to the task guide in my opinion.  It is based in real data that is collected by students themselves.  (That having been said  I wonder if a teacher might address sample bias here.  Are there mitigating factors?  What is the data telling us?  Are we trying to say something about the students in the class...or the school... or high school students in general?  In other words  what are the limits of what we can say about the data?)  The context is strong and probably engaging for students  although it is  not particularly important or relevant.  I might consider a context relevant to the community in which I was teaching  in a realm in which the students might make a difference.  Based on the statistical analysis the class might decide to take action in the community.

In my county  this past week was Digital Citizenship week.  The first task was to talk about what social media they use.  I would like to say here that I was shocked at some of the media sites my sixth graders use on a regular basis  but that was another discussion.  We created a dot plot of the social media used and how many used it.  The next day the students were asked to think about how long they are on social media on a daily basis.  We graphed the data using a histogram.  My sixth graders discovered that they spend too much time on social media and not on their studies.  Since data collect is not until a later unit  this was a great way to introduce the types of graphs and measures of center in a way that absolutely applies to them.  The airplane data was great for teaching students how to interact with large numbers.  I would love to do a follow up investigation on flight cancellations  since this topic impacts many travelers all to often.

I am wondering what you think about some of these tasks and how they do or do not provide opportunities for students to engage in statistical habits of mind and the four phases of the statistical investigation cycle.

Students need to be asked questions that allow them to use the visualization of the data in graphical form to answer things they can't answer from looking at the data in a table (e.g.  shape of the data and what that means in context).

I liked that the students took part in the data collection.  Also  that more than one class participated.  The students then created dot plots to compare the distribution.  They also see the variability between the two sets of data.  The questions posed at the end also helped contribute to the students' reasoning about the actual data collected.  The four questions asked:  1. Learning Goal:  I think the task provides a data context for the students to then measure.  2. Investigation cycle:  The students aren't posing the question themselves  but it is giving them an opportunity to see how to pose a question and then carry out the collection process.  3. The task promotes a \statistical habit of mind\"".  The students have to compare/contrast the data from the two groups and consider what is causing the differences.  4.  Things to change?   Something to consider might be comparing hours of TV watched and the scores on a test in the two groups. """

I like the openendedness of the question in that the students themselves must decide what strategies to use to answer the question. It also required them to support their opinion with statistical evidence.

I strongly believe that my students will like it very much since they can drink Pepsi or Coke while learning Statistics. By doing so this would engage the students and more willing to learn.    In addition to that  the students will be helping each other to study the given data sets  analyse it and report the results. This is collaborative learning style.  Thank you.

If they are not interested  usually they don't learn. They memorize. I chose the Old Faithful task  because it was having students work individual and group. I think students would learn through being able to ask themselves about the data and then discussing with their group. Now  I don't think information about Old Faithful is going to be as enticing as say video games or social media data  so I would change it up.

I think it is more interesting for the students to visualize their own data and compare it to other students data.  I think I would take it a little farther and have them show more investigation into the data.

I usually teach a night class in the Fall  so we could compare night students to day students. There are several variables we could use  such as age  or number of hours working per week  etc.

In it's current form  I believe it beings to promote a statistical habit  but with a few added questions  I believe it could address all aspects. It starts off well by allowing the students to think about the data and gather it. There is also plenty of room for discussion on bias  sampling error  and misuse (if students cheat and look at the front of the room). There is just enough guidance about what to do with the data (the skill and drill portion) and then they can go and interpret the data from there.  As soon as I started reading this activity  I immediately considered editing it to use diet sodas  especially a comparison of diet sodas using aspartame versus splenda. Health concerns aside  I know some have claimed weird after-taste with some diet sodas. I would also try to provide more room for discussion or questions to analyze the data beyond just confidence intervals and hypothesis testing. I feel like it is more of an exercise in its current form than something that really gets to them fully about the statistical process.    I started something similar this semester where I ask students to download a free app on their phone called Checky so we can analyze how often they unlock their phone on a daily basis. After this activity  I want to go back to mine and edit it to involve more concepts and interpretation rather than just mathematical skills.

It gives guidance and helps students learn how to conduct an experiment. Plus  it gets the entire class involved. And  as you said  it can be expanded a little to hit all 4 phases of the statistical process  and it can be transferred to other activities. I think it has a lot of potential!

What is needed is the data behind the information provided. Students could get the data associated with multiple vehicles: weight and MPG. From there  they could create a scatter diagram and then superimpose a linear regression line on that data.   Rather than giving the relationship between weight and MPG  students would develop this understanding. This could be followed up with a discussion about various predictions: e.g. weights inside the minimum and maximum values uncovered versus outside of the real data range.  The instructor could encourage a discussion on the  confidence interval about the regression line.

It's a nice blend between a book problem and an investigative task where they could easily collect some of their own data.  It would even be interesting to collect the cars the students have at home or are driving to school.  I'd also be interested in which students have to pay for gas when they drive!

I felt that the Television Time task was most relateable to middle school students because they can think about their own television watching times with interpreting the data and forming conclusions.  The context  measurement and visual display of data was clear and understandable for children at the middle school age.

Would change the experiment any way? For example  would you have students record the particular times they watch TV as well as the type of show? This experiment would be something that the students relate with because they all watch TV. I would also include any form of videos they watch on a technical device.  Great job!  Liliana Vega

They would find this activity engaging because they are able to touch the experiment and write the results right away. Some students may already be familiar with the tastes of Coke and Pepsi. Students would also be able to connect their own learning. If I were to rewrite the assignment  I might have the class do an interview or poll among each other before drinking the Coke and Pepsi. As a class we will plot our first data to see what is preferred  Pepsi or Coke. Then the class would perform the experiment. A student will flip the coin if it is heads Pepsi will be in cup A and Coke in cup B. Then if it is tails the cup A will have Coke and the Cup B Pepsi. As each students selects their preferences it will be recored. As a class the results will be plotted again. After the second plots  the results from the first plot and second plot will be compared. Students will be able to see if their information aligns before and after. This helps them see if it is enough to just interview or to conduct an experiment. In the first task they are able to see the name of the product. Whereas  in the second task they are all blind. That will help perform their statistical minds. I like the assignment because this helps the students critically think and everyone will be held accountable to put in effort and do their part of the work. This will also help differentiate with learners who need a visual to understand.

It doesn't have to be Pepsi vs. Coke if you don't have a lot of pop drinkers in class.  You can do a name brand vs. generic orange juice or even a taste test with chips or cookies (perhaps blind folds would be necessary for food tasting).  I also think one of the best follow-up discussions is about how many students actually prefer what they claim to prefer.  Having the preference beforehand definitely enriches the discussions.

I do a similar task with my students.  I pose the question: Are name brand cookies worth the extra money?  Then we go into the cycle (which I didn't know before the course but will continue to use and make sure I do a complete cycle with each unit I teach).  So then I ask the students how we can answer this question?  We then do a blind taste test like the pepsi and coke experiment  collect our data  analyze it and perform a hypothesis test. The students love this day  and the activity is good  but after taking this MOOC I am going to make sure I emphasize the cycle and each phase within it.

I liked the television watching task. I think that the students could easily collect this information for themselves. This would give them experience in writing surveys  or coming up with their own way to collect the data. Then they could analyze the data  and make charts and tables representing the data. Students could have the opportunity to work in groups collaboratively  which is an important skill for them to learn. I also think that they would be able to connect with this information  because most of them watch quiet a bit of information. I would also extend this to include any technology time  not just television. Then they could compare the different types of technology  and what is used most.

Statistic in algebra 1  is more introductory statistics but it is very important for kids to learn how  to compare  discuss and communicate their thinking. I definitely support idea  that students should visualize data and then compare it. I did very similar  assignment in my algebra 1 class. Students had to go and collect data with a students  in the class that I already arrange with teacher. Then  I divided students into  two groups and they represented their data visually.  Then we did the same assignment with other  class. Students create all kinds of graphs and we talked about which graphs  represented better data as well as finding mean/median.

With that said The Coke vs Pepsi task is a  task that many students as well as adults could relate to as well as  participate in collecting the data.                The television time task is great task; I would also include  video-streaming time as well.  I know of  many school age students that will watch complete episodes or movies on their  mobile devices to include phones  I-pads  tablets and computers.   I would have the students record total time  they watch TV as well as all various forms of video.  One could create different data sets one for  actual time watching TV and one for time using video streaming.   Either way it is important to engage  students in order to encourage   good  statistical practices.

When I am teaching algebra in math class  I teach my students to first look at the function and ask themselves: what kind of function is it? what are the characteristics? what do you know about domain and range? how does a plot look like? Etc. The habit of first investigating the given information can easily be tranformed to statistical habits. When analysing data you can teach students to first ask themselves questions like: what do the data tell you? what are the characteristics? wat visualisation can be used? Etc.

It is a pure mathematical task.  All of the responses are produced from evaluating an equation.  Part a should be eliminated as this skill is not necessary in most real world contexts.  Part b should ask a follow up about how confident the student is in the prediction or in some way reference the residual for the prediction and what it means.  Part c is ok but I would prefer an interpretation of the slope and intercept in the context of the problem.  Part d should interpret the coefficient of determination along with finding it's value.  Finally  there is no graph or reference to the graph which is critical for any regression analysis.     Task 2 is littered with poor statistical practice and reinforces misconceptions throughout.  While the task is engaging and fun it does not require statistics to complete it.  The question of interest is how many students in the room prefer coke to pepsi and once that value is computed the task is done.  Inference is not required nor appropriate!  Students need to consider a random sample of students from their school rather than the students in the room  they need to sample enough students to ensure the conditions for inference will be met  and once they have collected and analyzed their data they need to think about how far they can infer based on their results.  The task is essentially doing a census and students often then want to do inference which is not required when you do a census.    Task 3 has the most potential to be a rich task.  Students are comparing the center and variability of two distributions and asked to justify their reasoning based on data.  My biggest concern is that the plot is not appropriate.  Instead there should be two separate dot plots.  Stacking the dots makes it hard to discern the peaks and valleys in each distribution which could indicated patterns or clusters of data that should be addressed.

Also I think it gives an idea of the investigative cycle  so even if it is not a random sample the students see that you can pose a question  collect data  analyze data and interpret results.   To me the weakness of that task is that the purpose of the randomization is not made clear.  This is something that I would discuss with the class. I think it is a chance to also talk about a blind versus double blind study.   Later I think I'd want to do an investigation where there are two experimental conditions or instead of having students taste two drinks  have them be randomly assigned to one or the other and have them rate it on a scale of 1 to 10.

In fact  the current visual depictions would probably confuse several students.  I agree with Craig's analysis of Task 1 but I think it has a lot of potential as an intro to regression.  It does a nice job of giving real-world context  and provides a direct example of how regression can be useful.  I think it can be used to help students conceptualize what regression can be used for  but then I would also add more in-depth analysis (and definitely a graph!).

I think the first is more of a book question than a task  but see how you could use the framework and have students collect data.  I suggested in another post that the data used is about the cars the students have at home.  Perhaps take a field trip to the faculty parking lot!  Once they have the make and model  they can find average MPG on the manufacturer's website.  I've done the second task in class and think the beauty is in having a discussion about how to address these issues.  Students need to determine the set up of the task such as flipping a coin to determine if they drink from cup A or B first  do they need a sip of water in between tastes  etc. I've really enjoyed doing this one.  I'll agree on the third task though.  I like the question  but I'm not a fan of the graphical display.  If anything  I'd use it as an example of how to interpret such a graph and perhaps recreate so there are two separate dot plots.

Pushing high school students to think about the meaning of the data and whether there are meaningful differences in wait times could give a context to p-values and other measures of significance.

As it sits on the paper it looks very mathematical.  I say pose a question  have students collect their own data  then perform the analysis the task is requiring and you this analysis to answer the question posed at the beginning.  Task 2: This is my favorite  but I do a modified version.  I ask students: Is it worth the money to buy name brand food?  For example  chocolate cookies.  We then have a discussion on what they think  which brands they buy and so on.  Then I ask them  how we could answer our question.  After some discussion they say we should do an experiment and see who likes the tastes.  Then I bring in cookies and we do a taste test.  I get chips-a-hoy and the dollar store cookies.  We collect data and then do a hypothesis test to test our claim.  I make a claim that there is no difference  and we test this claim.  Then we can answer our question.  Students are always shocked by the results and every class so far has come to the conclusion that there is no difference and therefore  brand name cookies are not worth the extra money since there is no difference.  I think with the right questions and discussion  some great statistical habits of mind can be covered with this task.    Task 3: I like that students are looking at the spread and variability within this task. Yet  I would want to take away the dot plot  give the students the data  and ask them the best way to represent it and draw conclusions from the data based on their different presentations.

The Pepsi vs. Coke task sounds like the most fun because it is more of an activity and of course there is food involved.  It was also rather comprehensive in including several statistical ideas - gathering your own data in an experiment (Collect phase)  using that to make decisions about products (Analyze)  and conduct tests/confidence intervals (Interpret).  However  it did not allow them much thinking on their own...there were steps to follow and specific calculations to conduct.  I found that to be similar with Task 1  only it was missing the Collect phase of a statical task.  Students are given a specific question to answer with specific data and specific formulas to use to calculate with.  I think this is a valuable activity to show students where statistical ideas are used in a real world context  but does not allow them for much free-thinking or working through a statistical problem on their own.  I would improve this task by maybe adding some more open ended questions at the end  such as \What else could we use the information in this problem for?\""  \""What can we NOT use it for?\""  Perhaps we could lead into this or follow it up with a similar problem where students do collect their own bivariate data  calculate their means  standard deviation  and correlation  and describe what they learned about the relationship between their own two variables.  Ultimately I \""voted\"" for task 3 in the activity.  It would allow students to think through different options of analyzation and interpretation without being told specifically what to do.

The lesson allows the students to become data investigators rather than just giving them a data set and asking them to answer a set of procedural type questions. This exercise allows the students to start making connections between the statistics and the context of the data to make a group decision about how long the students would predict that you need to wait between blasts of Old Faithful if you arrived just as Old Faithful had finished erupting. This process of transnumeration is important skills for middle school students to start to learn before taking a more formal statistics course in high school or college.   The only change I think I would make to the exercise is have the students look at the data in a software program like FAthom or TinkerPlots if the resources are available. This allows the students to more easily create graphical representations and even look at a larger amount of data to make their predictions.   I have also uploaded an interesting article by Dr. Shaughnessy and Dr. Pfannkuch about the Old Faithful data.

From this course I have learned that statistics can be in anything. Probability  experiment  and all kinds of math. This could be a great way for you to integrate statistics into other lessons. I teach first grade and I have to integrate many different things with other subjects because I cannot get everything done if I don't.  I would see what you can integrate  also  because statistics isn't always statistics as someone else has stated.  Liliana Vega

If you are trying to analyze a linear  quadratic  polynomial... relationships you can collect data  construct models  and make conjectures that all incorporate the statistics cycle.  Asking questions about where the data came from  how much do we trust our model  and to whom can we extend our predictions to all ask students to think statistically.  Teaching statistics is about teaching the process of thinking statistically.  Posing questions that ask students to question the origins  validity  and extend-ability of data all get them in this mindset.

Those teachers use every opportunity not to teach the statistical parts of the curriculum  mainly excusing themselves by either declaring the topic as not relevant for their students or claiming that they don't have enough time to teach the topic.  One good way to counter both strategies is to use technology to make dreadful calculations more easy and let teachers and students alike \play\"" with data. So far in this course  there have been some great examples showing us how to do it. """

I live in a state that can't seem to make up its mind.  We added Common Core Math 3 three years ago.  The curriculum for this course with statistics has changed every year.  It is also used as the last unit we are to accomplish each year.  I have to admit that  I have only made it to the unit once in the 3 years.  I think that as a community of teachers  we need to let the states know how important statistics as a course is in today's world.  In North Carolina students need to complete 4 credits in mathematics.  There must be one credit earned higher than Math 3.  I think it should be a required statistics class.

Although it would be nice to think globally  sometimes it's nice to have them conduct research closer to home than using existing data sets.  One of my favorite projects dealt with whether or not HS girls at our school preferred jeans or leggings.  The school is comprised of about 2000 students  half of whom are girls.  They then had to design a process by contacting the registrar for listing of students  do a probability sample  they had to deal with questions of legging or jegging  etc.  My role was adviser or conduit to other resources.  Their project involved a little more than this question  but this was \their\"" research question.

It could be running  throwing paper balls into a wastebasket  pulse before and after exercise  holding breath  standing on one foot with eyes closed  etc. They have to decide how much replication to do  and how much time to leave between replications due to fatigue  etc.  This gets the blood moving during class  too!  It runs the risk of embarrassing some less-fit students  though  depending on what the events are. The same could work for a college bio-statistics class. Some things would depend more on random sampling  and others on random assignment (mildly hyperventilate for 1 minute before holding breath? eyes open or closed during balance test?). """

Justify your choice. Is it worthwhile investing in this movie? These questions would make them make a comparison of the two using the median as a measure of center  and also look at their shapes and describe the skew which would actually make them choose the median for comparison.  In the scatter plot the questions would be: Is there a relationship between the 2 variables  and if so  what is the direction of the relationship? Are there outliers in the data? This would make the students consider the positive relationship and explain what it means; for outliers  they would state the point which is an outlier and explain what it means in the context of the study.

Students could be asked to look at the frequency of Dreamworks movies that are rated above the Pixar mean. The real question is 'so what?'.  Graph 2 gives an opportunity to answer that question.  Graph 2: Budget versus Profit can be an important question. In graph 2  students could be asked to determine if there is a relationship between budget and profit. The question could be asked from three perspectives: (a) for Pixar; (b) for Dreamworks; and (c) combined.    A third dimension (combining the data from the two graphs) is needed to determine if there is a relationship between popularity and budget  popularity and profit.  The TUVA data can be copied and manipulated by students to try to understand these relationships.    After doing this work  the interesting discussion would be what kind of investment would you make in a movie and what should you expect as a financial result from that investment.

If I were teaching statistics  I would use this website to launch discussions about the four phases of the investigation cycle with my students.  For example  if I wanted to focus on the Pose phase  I might pull two attributes (month  profit) and have a large group discussion about questions that could be asked.  Then  in small groups  I would give my students a few more pairs of attributes and have them generate questions.  I would also ask them to create their own pairs of attributes and generate questions from them.  Then  ultimately we'd come back together and discuss the questions as a large group.      I believe the students would stay engaged because of the topic would be appealing to all students. I also think the students would play around with the graphical displays and this would probably help them think of more questions.

They would have to argue both sides and could essentially have a debate over questions posed by the teacher who would have the role of the person with the money.  1. Why should I go with your studio based on your rotten tomatoes rating?  Is rotten tomatoes rating a valid source for evaluating how well a movie will do?    2. How much profit can I expect to earn if I give you X amount of funding?  How confident are you in that value?  Why?  What is the relationship between funding and the profits at your studio?

We will look more carefully at what makes a good statistical question in Unit 4 Essentials!   In general  we want statistical questions to have to require the use of data to answer them  and to need make sense of variability in data to answer.  The key is that there are trends in data to help us make claims  but that those claims have a level of uncertainty in them.  For example  asking  which movie was the most expensive to make requires data to answer  but does not require us to make sense of variability in the data  because we are only looking for the data point with the highest budget value. But your question on \which movie studio is the most profitable\"" could be slightly tweaked to say \""which movie studio tends to produce movies with the most profit?\"" that makes it more statistical.

A lot of our students come in expecting something more math-y.  My experience this semester is that by giving each student ownership of their own small data set  they come across these problems and raise the questions.  Then  we can have a whole class discussion about strategies.  For example  only some of my students had missing data on one of the variables and they were wondering why the Ns were different for the different tables. So that got me a chance to talk about missing data and a little bit about how we might want to handle it (ignore versus something else).

Answer: It depends on what you want to teach them and what resources you have at your disposal.  When you have to do caclculations more or less by hand (or by a calculator) even a dataset consisting of 20 numbers might be considered as large. But when you have a statistical software at hand  millions of numbers might be nothing to you.  Personally  I think it is better to use small data sets  because students get to understand what they are doing better than when they are dealing with datasets they can't get a feel for it. When students collect their own data  they normally end up with small data sets.  On the other hand  missing data are very common  therefore using multidimensional messy data sets probably let students learn more than data sets which are just large.  But the most important point is not whether the data is messy or large. The really important question is: Is the data of any interest to the students?

In the United States  it is complicated since the teaching of statistics in K-12 classrooms is primarily done by mathematics teachers per the Common Core Standards. Even a the college level  many mathematicians are teaching statistics courses and do not understand the differences between mathematics and statistics.     One interesting activity I've done with my college students is to ask them to make a Venn Diagram showing the relationship between math  statistics  and probability. Then they have to put at least one topic in each portion of the diagram. They do this in groups then the groups share out to the class. It always sparks interesting discussion and get this thinking more deeply about differences between math and statistics.

I try to remind my students about the many failed experiments that never get published and how time consuming it truly is to collect data.  The discussion helped reinforce these ideas and my passion to help students recognize how valuable statistics will be in their lives.   I share with students during the first week of school and with parents at Open House that you can get a doctorate in statistics! It's unlike any other mathematics course and we are only scratching the surface in our AP course.  It also only exists with other disciplines.  I enjoyed the example of middle school social studies and science courses using statistical principles.  Exposure is so important and it doesn't have to be the formal statistical learning that occurs at higher levels.   The importance of where the data come from and why (if you're not the one collecting it) is something I stress every year with my students.  It sometimes creates 17 year old conspiracy theorists  but I think it's important they do more than read headlines.  I want them to learn to question the results being presented because they are living in an age of data. It won't only be in their professional lives  but personal lives as well.  For instance  what parenting techniques are best and why?  It's not something that's easy or quick to measure  but there sure is a lot of advice out there on the subject!

Whether they have the sophistication to pursue answers to those questions depends on the specific question  but the Khan Academy video that Hollylynn suggests in her post could be a good starting point.  He asks some silly questions like \How much does my pet grapefruit weigh\"" and \""How many teeth does my mother have\"" and does a good job of discussing in a basic way whether or not they are statistical.  Once that is established  I think elementary students would have fun brainstorming examples of each type of question.  Then they could gather data and graph once appropriate sample data has been chosen.  I teach high schoolers during the school year but work with recent 5th graders over the summer  and they are some of the best question-askers I know.

In addition  I think that asking a statistical question and collecting data from the whole class to answer that question is a great activity as well that allows you to informally introduce the concept of a census. Then  you could take the lesson a step further and get the students to start thinking about how could the statistical question be answered using students from the entire school. This usually leads into a basic discussion of what a sample is. Also  I think using the data collection by the class to make bar graphs on a white board is a great exercise for students that then allows the teaching of mean  median  and mode to be tied to the tangible graph. Also  I think elementary school students are much more engaged when they are calculating those statistics using data that they collected.   There are interesting lesson plans for elementary school students on the American Statistical Association Statistics Education Website.

Perhaps an experience like that was why the one child in the first video kept saying  \""They're close enough - the die is fair!\"" until it was very obvious with 3000 rolls that it wasn't. I also found it interesting in the video with the chi-square test how what looked obviously unfair to the naked eye (although I knew exactly how unfair the die was  so that biased my observation) was not unfair enough to have the chi-square test say that it was unfair. It is sad that they didn't follow up by doing more trials.  As for doing a real-life test with unfair dice - I sort of hope one can't buy them easily! You could probably add a little weight to some of the sides of a regular die by gluing something to them. Obviously unfair  and the students could try to figure out how unfair the changes make the die. Just a thought . . .  """

I think this would be a great way to introduce statistics to my middle school students and look forward to using it in my classroom.  In the videos  the first and last set of middle school students seemed to have some understanding of statistical reasoning.  They were able to look at the data and recognize that they needed to conduct further trials.  I'm not sure that I completely understand the levels myself yet  but I think they may have been approaching Level B whereas the second group of middle school students seemed to be at Level A.  I hope the high school students were at Level C at least because I don't understand what they were talking about.  Hopefully as this MOOC continues  I will have a much better understanding.

I think that the class could have a great discussion about the differences between the results of the first two groups  why the groups got the results they did  and how to get more accurate results.    I have had students do activities like this before without a computerized simulation in order to emphasize the importance of sample size.  They would predict what would happen  roll the die 20 times  and then analyze their own results.  We would then come together as a class  combining all of our data  and analyze the results of all 600 trials.  Because it was a hands-on activity  the students were involved an excited about the results  which allowed us to have great conversations about the process and the outcomes.

Both partners were discussing how it was it was a fair dice. The computer helped them by having the students critically think about their next move. The first pair of boys kept rolling until they got to 3 000.Then the girls rolled until they got to 36. They used and algorithm to find a good stopping point. Even with the AP Stats students  they were able to show their work to prove if the dice was fair or unfair. Eventually  at some point the students thought that the outcomes would even out.

They were able to see from their simulation that they may need to do a hypothesis test  specifically a chi-square test.  Once they did the hypothesis test  they could make their conclusion.  The technology tool was a great resource for the students in being able to answer the question on which die is fair.   With all 3 scenarios  I could see having a discussion with the class about the results.  Especially  if students present different results when analyzing the same data.  It would be a great way to talk about how the sample size can affect the results of the data analysis.  Also  how hypothesis testing can help back claims of the analysis.

I particularly liked the Working with a Dynamic Survey Tool with Brandon and Manuel. This really helped me see how students would start and progress through the different levels. I felt that they initially started as Level A  but as they kept discussing the outcomes  they were moving into Level B.    I think the technology is a critical part in both demonstrations. Most of the students realized or felt that something didn't \feel\"" right and investigated further by running more trials which would be impossible without the technology. The other advantage of the technology is that students can immediately jump into analyzing the results by looking at graphs or p-values without all of the complicated formulas (chi-square test in particular) that would have drawn their attention away from thinking about the data.

I thought it was telling of the younger students to think you needed a multiple of 6 in order to have a good sample size  but eventually both age groups knew that what you needed what a large sample size in order to have a good basis for a decision.    Before I watched these videos  I looked into the three options: Tinkerplots  Statcrunch  and the Geogebra.  I am not really familiar with any  but noticed that you need to have a membership for Statcrunch and that you have to pay for Tinkerplots.  It did not seem to be a high charge  but because of that  it would not be something readily available at my school.  I could see justifying the charge for an AP stats class  but if I just wanted to try it out for a unit during a different class  I am not sure I would get the support for it.    Geogebra  on the other hand  is something easily used by students as everyone has an iPad and it could be web-based.  So I used that one when playing with it on my own.  When I watched the videos however  I thought the ability to watch the data gather dynamically was huge.  Students could see how the bars changed over time and not just the final outcome.  If they have been studying statistics  they know about sampling variation and could just attribute the end graph to SV.  But when the data is gathered dynamically and one bar is always particularly low or high  that is harder to make an argument for.  It would be nice to have a free software with this capability.  Software aside  I thought both sets of students were able to have meaningful discussions about the fairness of the dice and support their arguments with data that they chosen how to gather.  I liked watching different groups gather data about the same dice for another perspective.

It was interesting to see how some students had a more in-depth conversation about the number of times to run the simulation while other students just decided on a number and moved forward with the simulation without much discussion.   I thought it was also interesting to see the different statistical habits of mind play out more in some student discussions compared to other student discussions. I think using the simulation tools were a great resource for the students to use because it allowed the students to run the simulations at larger sample sizes than they could have done on their own. Also  the one group of two boys had an interesting discussion about the different probabilities while watching the simulation for a sample size of 3000.

They seemed to all be at different levels. Again  to repeat what several others have said  I am not sure I completely understand or can I wrap my mind around the levels  but I could definitely see that the students were at different levels of reasoning and application.  I love that GeoGebra is free. I have some limits as I will be teaching a college class at a high school in January.  I have been using StatCrunch  but GeoGebra will definitely be a good option. This will be a good exploration activity to have students use to explore probability distributions and determine if a \game\"" is fair. """

A way I found would wonderful using technology. I have found the use of spreadsheets being very effective. The students  of course  are taught how to input the algorithm and they are able to double check their answers. That will get them to critically think to show why the answer is the same  or to redo the problem if they got it wrong. Since some statistical evidence is plotted onto graphs  this is a great way to show them that. The use of spreadsheets will have them engaged because all students love technology and will prepare them for the real world. A lot of jobs have the use of the spreadsheet to document and data entry. Of course  I would incorporate any type of appropriate manipulatives. From experience  I have seen all students more engaged when they are able to touch the material to support their learning.   Thank you for your insights   Liliana Vega

This will make students more engage in activity  and most important they will need to discuss about their conclusion and provide evidence. My students will definitely enjoy this.

Early on the students could reason using the graph and a high number of trials to get at the law of large numbers.

Hopefully they will reference their earlier work and refer back to the graphs which will complement the numerical analysis they have learned.

Also slight variations from randomness are the basis for numerous computer hacks of passwords.   I think one thing you could do is actually generate a lot of random numbers by whatever means and see if they are uniform (and how large the number is before you feel comfortable with this.  You could also use an old school table of random numbers and experiment with that.  What is the actual frequency of digits? Can you predict the next digit in a column/row?  I always at least show a physical table to my class.  The old NCTM data strand examples had this great exercise where you had students \""randomly\"" break a piece of spaghetti into 3 parts and see if they could make a triangle from it.

That was never my justification for starting with the physical model  but perhaps that is part of it.  The reason I like to start with the physical model is to SLOW THEM DOWN!  They tend to focus too much on the end result and whatever magic happens to get them there.  These simulations and discussions about probability make the most sense to my students when they see the sampling distributions being built.  I like to combine data from the class sections so it's not too tedious (so every student in each of my classes does 5-10 trials instead of having to do 20-30 each).    I also remind them throughout the year how all of these concepts are building and how we will use them for our inference procedures.  This is not something I was able to do when teaching the course for the first time  but is very powerful now that I have a few years experience.

However  because I work with university students  it was a little hard for me to scale up some of the concepts beyond K-12. Additionally  I think there is much more variability in college students' statistical literacy (likely due in part to increased  yet inconsistent statistical training in K-12). Developing approaches to successfully scaffold statistical concepts to college students with a great range of statistical literacy will continue to be a challenge in a large lecture setting.

I have discussed this with others and we also believe it stems from poor reading comprehension as well as a lack of statistical literacy.    At the beginning of this unit  I felt that I needed to be teaching my students at level C which got me scrambling to think about handling the variability that you mentioned. I enjoyed  however  reading that students need to address all three levels which made me realized that I could address that variability.  As you said  it will still be a challenge  but one that I feel is now surmountable  but probably in baby steps.

My students do lack any statistical knowledge coming into my college level classroom.  In addition  their reading comprehension  in some cases  is terribly low.  The video about the mean gave me some clarity about how I might improve my approach introducing the mean and discussing variability.  I don't think I've spent enough time having my students explain what the mean represents.

I've been trying to figure out an alternative.  One thing about the video is how Christine Franklin just quickly rounds down to a mean of 6.  This makes sense at level A but I've been wondering about whether it makes sense to do a fraction there if you are working with college students especially.  That helps explain why people can have a mean of 1.8 children!

However  I think with six companies  it would be much more beneficial to leave them with partners and them maybe have the partners get together with the other partners to have them discuss their results concerning the company they were given to research. I just don't know if in the larger groups  some students might disengage themselves and just go along with others.  Although it was discussed by the students in the animation  I love the idea of discussing \What is fair?\"" and then extending that to the idea of \""what would make for a good model?\"" I like to use these kind of things to preview to students what is coming down the road. For example  when we are talking about the mean age of students  I like to have them think about the average age of a student posted by the college and tell them that we will test it later on. We can talk about if our class is a representative sample and what would make a good sample. When we arrive at hypothesis testing  I revisit that question and we test the claim. My goal this semester is to have them develop higher levels of statistical reasoning now that I understand them a little better.  """

I teach college statistics.  I think I've just assumed (wrongly) that my students had a basic understanding of the A or B concepts that were discussed in the Gaise document.  What I realized by taking part in this MOOC is that I definitely need to address this lack of knowledge. They can calculate a mean all day long  but they struggle with explaining what it represents.  The variability is also something that they have trouble grasping.  I am definitely going to reevaluate my teaching of these introductory concepts.

Students come into my statistics class having already taken an introductory college-level stats class.  However  many still struggle with the concept of mean and especially with variability.  I try to emphasize the meanings rather than the calculations  so that they can understand what z-scores and then  eventually  hypothesis testing actually do.  I'm feeling that I have to incorporate more on these meanings if I want them to think at the C level - tendencies and representations of populations  etc.

I think another extension of this task that can be introducing students at the high school level to the concept that is used in this task of repeated random sampling and how it differs from one random sample. In addition  explaining why this concept is important in statistics and how we can use repeated random sampling to make inferences about the population are higher levels of sophisticated statistical reasoning that this task can use. I have attached a lesson plan that I think would be a great resource as well to this higher level of reasoning from the American Statistical Association STEW website.  """

An AP Stats class could talk about chi-squared tests  and how the same ratios at a larger sample size give more evidence of disparate impact (stronger p-values).

It reinforces that we are just covering topics in an intro to statistics course and while it should help them to be more informed and productive adults  there will be many complicated questions in the future (career issues or perhaps future health issues they might have).  It was scary when I was first teaching  but I will now often let students make these mistakes with the questions so they can flush out the issues.  When they start asking or collecting measurements and they hit roadblocks  it helps them to recognize the difference in what they intended to do and what the design is allowing them to do.  I can always tell them about these issues in advance or make corrections before they start  but they learn a lot from these types of mistakes!

What I also really like from the video is that the students naturally went to inference (Is this true for all people...) and they really questioned the source of the data and how it was collected.  We can have students pose awesome questions that ask them to think deeply about a topic but unless they have valid data collection methods the ability to infer anything from the data can be limited.  It reinforces the cycle of statistical thinking and that no one part of the process is more important than another.  It also emphasizes the notion that creating the question is important but planning on how to answer it is equally important.

As I kept hearing more than 60 minutes  I thought those may be special cases that would be outliers to the data that would change the results. What I will take to teach my students will be to think about all affecting variables. For example  for this video it would be: Do you have the same transportation to school daily? Are there any variables that may change your results?

Also in rural areas students might be on a bus for over an hour to get school since the bus has such a big area to cover.  You are right to have your students question outliers.

I love to show my students data and discuss possible outliers.  Taking a boat to get to school in NC may not be a mode of transportation that is used.  Also  commute time could have outliers that need to be looked at and discussed.  I think if I were to bring in raw data for my students to look at  I would have them start out similar to the way the students started in the video.  Begin with a discussion while looking at the data.  Form you questions and possibly a hypothesis (at the introductory stats level).

I saw that one of the options was that you could pull the data from your own class rather than from across a state or country.    Even if you just showed them the questions  you could have them talk about some of the measurement issues. For example  will everyone measure the length of their index finger (or their foot) exactly the same way?  I agree that it might be a bit more difficult to analyze these types of issues when the data is simply presented to students.

Even the text messaging numbers were fairly iffy--students talked about one day vs. another or weekends vs. weekdays  etc.

For example  for the 5th/6th graders  it is a summer camp atmosphere where some students come from other countries.  When asking \What is your height?\"" or \""What is your shoe size?\"" they can get very different numbers because of the sizing rules in different countries or because one country can measure in centimeters while another measures in inches.    During the expert panel discussion  the example was given of someone responding 10 000 to a question about the number of texts received in a day.  In my high school class  students start off the year with survey questions asked of the whole class.  Sometimes they are just bad at estimating...there is quite the range of numbers given for how tall in feet they think our local mountain is  or how many miles away from where they are born they are  and some are just unreasonable.

One way to combat the unexpected answers would be to have students develop questions in teams and trade surveys  asking the other team to brainstorm potential issues with the questions and what could be changed about the question to avoid these issues.

I have really appreciated the videos  articles  and explanations  but I think I'm still a little unsure of how exactly to put it all together.  I think I have begun to grasp Level A  B  and C  but where do I begin?  I would love to work with all of you on one of these if we could do it in this discussion.  I just learn better by doing.  My students are very interested in technology  so I would like to build a statistical question around technology or technology use.  Perhaps it could include the amount of time spent on technology.  Maybe we could look at if there is a correlation between technology use and grades or social interaction.

Students have to walk before they run.  I've found that if you try to have students consider all of these different aspects that they get overwhelmed and loose focus on the important details.  Developing statistical thinking in students is a process.  What I have found to be successful is to focus on a particular aspect of the cycle  teach it explicitly so that students develop a deep understanding and then revisit that context in the future to explore a different aspect of the cycle.  As you revisit previously discussed topics students already have a familiarity and an interest.  Seeing that same context through a different lens allows them to focus on the new aspect you are trying to teach.  Find a good context and think about how it can be used in multiple ways throughout the year.  Don't do it all at once!

My students discussed whether someone could really send 10000 text messages.  They thought someone might--but obviously not on average everyday (and not on school days).  We also did an activity with height and armspread.  I have two very tall students and one has relatively shorter armspread  comparatively.  We also have a fairly short student with longer armspread.  In discussion  we realized that we wanted to remeasure and check (which we did) but that these values might be \thrown out\"" if someone were just cleaning data--but probably our one class does not just happen to have 2 outliers to that extreme.  One question was whether Michael Phelps is an outlier that should be \""removed.\""  Certainly these values should not be removed early on.  A good chance to talk about calculated mean and median with and without outliers and consider what the answer means.   """

At the same time  advances in the calculator functions have allowed me to focus on the analyze and interpret phases rather than getting bogged down in the calculations. They also make it easier for testing to just have them use their individual calculators.   However  software packages for computers are easier to use for the pose and collect phases  but they pose a testing hazard in the students have access to the full internet to try to find answers.  If anyone already uses technology like StatCrunch  TinkerPlots  etc.  how do you address testing and the high demand for calculators everywhere else?

Very much so. But  I will also say that if we do not incorporate technology into the classroom  we are doing our students a great disservice. The TI is a tool that allows us to quickly cover several topics without spending to much time on the inside math. You can buy a used TI 83 on Amazon for $25. Excel is a spreadsheet that can be used in many situations at school  work  and life. Excel is free for students. I do worry that some of the smaller stats programs will not be used by them in the future.

And mostly a calculator is fine for computations with small datasets. However  today's datasets are mostly much larger than what you can do by hand or even with a calculator  therefore more advances options need also to be covered in class.

While calculators work for smaller data sets (like those in a textbook)  we often get into data sets that are too large for the calculator.  I came across this problem with data sets that we collected ourselves  inputting 50 - 100 data points without mistakes is very difficult and mistakes are much easier to catch on a computer screen.

I appreciate that most won't walk into an office with a TI  but I think they should be able to learn to use whatever technology is given.  There are so many different stat packages available and I have no idea which will be used by them in the future.  I think they need to try different technologies so they can learn how to learn from them. Much of the focus in my class is also on the analysis and interpretation of the numbers so we are are using the calculator to save time (and prevent error) with crunching numbers.

It seems to me there are a few types of messy data:  a) data with outliers  inliers  nonsense  or missing value (but still well structured  e.g. in columns)  b) data with formatting issues: turning 20161118 into a date format that is useable to do arithmetic  for example  or recoding \Mon/Wed Section\"" and \""Tue/Thu Section\"" into 0 and 1.  c) data that isn't structured for analysis. A minimal example would be joining two tables  like a pre-test and a post-test score  based on the student's ID number. Or the Lake Travis data  which I like but would need to be put into one big column to do other types of analysis.  There are probably others. The question we're struggling with in our MOOC-ed PLC is what level of messy data is appropriate for which classes: Stat 101? Stats for Future Teachers? Stats for Scientists and Engineers? Stat-major senior-level classes?  Opinions?   (PS: there's also text analysis  audio file analysis  image analysis  and video analysis  but those are so far advanced we don't usually even consider them in a stat major curriculum. Though data science people do some text analysis.) """

For instance  when you introduce a new technique or a calculation messy data will obscure the message and not be very helpful.  However  if the aim is to teach the overall statistical process  messy data might be a remainder to your students  why certain guidelines need to be followed.  Also. the more advanced your students are  the less of a problem should messy data cause.

What I found most useful for me is how to use real data sets in class.  Many times when I have my students work on examples in class it is just data that came from the book.  I saved the pdf from this module that has a list of data sets that can be used.  I think if I could have my students access real data and use it for analyzing and interpreting  they would be more engaged in the coursework.

I previously enjoyed teaching statistics before this MOOC  however I lacked knowing how  to you incorporate real life scenarios to my students learning experience. This class has assisted in my own overall understanding. One of my favorite activities we completed was the transportation activity where multiple students were asked if they walked to school  road in a car to school  or road on a bus to school. I really loved watching how the video clip narrowed down the options  and decided to make that information much easier to collect. This was more on the grade level that I'm teaching this school year.

I feel like if I prompt them to ask their own questions  but then their questions don't work with the topic I wanted the class to focus on that day  they might feel frustrated in a way they wouldn't if I posed the question aloud before asking their opinion.  Or maybe the idea is to keep bringing in data sets and working on whatever good questions get posed  without having a topic in mind for each day  and over the course of the semester there's a high probability that every important topic and related method would come up?

This MOOC has provided some excellent resources to help me start to emphasize that more in my classes. In particular is the use of technology  especially StatCrunch  which I just started using in my class this semester.

This class has made me more confident that students should be investigating on their own as much as possible  with lots of team and my support.

I have always enjoyed the inference part of the teaching intro stats more than the other parts only because I saw the benefit of stats in decision-making.  This course has made me re-think the presentation of ideas so that I place a greater emphasis (in mindset not necessarily time) on data production.  This recent video is making me think about the early part of the AP stats course on descriptive statistics.  I hadn't really thought about the data-rich society that we live in and that the wealth of data makes some sampling-to-inference less necessary (not less meaningful).  Thought provoking.... 
52,Teaching Statistics Through Data Investigations - Fall 2016,616,Discuss With Your Colleagues,14965,Future of Stats,10900,10460,10900,39696,16/11/26 18:05:57,40303,Re: Future of Stats, I also found the idea that our data is now so available and sets are so large that inference as we think about it may be less important.  Of course I think that was also done before our US election and both the inferences and the assumption that the size of polling data were giving us good information led to problems.  So while I think that the large data set and using it with students is part of the wave of the future  interpreting and understanding probabilities seems even more essential (granted  a bit different than statistical inference).

I find myself wondering what can be done about this?  Education is limited in time and resources...statistics is only 1 class that I teach  and I am the only teacher of AP Statistics at my school.  One major reason I took this class was to engage with other teachers who teach statistics because I am somewhat isolated at my school in that regard.  However  I find that opportunities like this are few and far between and usually cost a lot.  Technology can cost a lot and is also not always supported by the budget limitations at schools.  Also  when student learning is measured by standardized tests that do not allow the use of technology beyond calculators  that does not help the case to make the technology more readily available.    What ideas are out there to help the teaching of statistics catch up with the demand?

I am in a small group that has been discussing the MOOC periodically  and last time we met there was quite a discussion about what part cleaning data should have in statistics courses. It would appear that this is a major topic for the future. I had not even thought about it prior to this experience. Note that I have also not been involved in teaching statistics for many years.

I feel that there are too many technology tools out there that are free and making the choice of which ones to use can be overwhelming.  There is no one tool that does everything exactly the way I want it to so I am constantly weighing the tradeoffs of teaching students how to use a new tool versus the educational gains that come from using the tool.  Many of the tools out there are specifically designed for teaching concepts but I find that if these are not tools that they will use outside of my class the benefit of teaching them is limited.  On the other hand I try to use software like JMP since it is widely used in the real world of statistics but there is a very high learning curve to teaching it and sometimes the interface takes away from the conceptual understanding that another tool may bring.  I want students doing statistics in a meaningful way but I also have time constraints and a curriculum to cover.  In my years as a stat teacher I have seen more and more effective resources developed and shared and my hope is that this will continue.

I was amazed to see how quickly they improved their understanding of what a good picture is  simply because feedback was immediate and whenever they failed in an attempt  they could just try again and compare there different results. Gone were the days when you had to wait for hours or even days before you could see what you've acutally had in front of the camera.  I think  the same principle applies when we use sophisticated technology in statistics. When students actually see the consequences of what they are doing (or changing) immediately  their learning curve is much steeper than without that feedback.  Of course  the will still need guidance to ask the right questions as they need some hints about how to take a good picture. Therefore  visual feedback alone doesn't do the trick. But combining good questioning  visual feedback and a good representation of basic concepts can certainly improve teaching and learning.

I recently attended a conference on simulation based teaching of statistics and found that seeing pictures of large amounts of data help students formulate a conception of inference (what should/should not be rejected) more than any explaining I have ever tried to do.  Nothing makes simulation based explanation better and easier than technology--the more dynamic  the better. I am interested in using those techniques and the ones learned in this course about discourse as I continue in my teaching.

It was 1972.  There were no such things as calculators and the computer at school was for computer courses only. (computer took up a huge room the size of several classrooms)  We had to do everything by hand and that took up most of our time.  I am amazed and excited by the technology we have today.

It was clear what I was teaching my students and what I wasn't.   It really all came together for me here in Unit 5 in one of the videos when after analyzing and interpreting the data  a student asked a very good question about why people responded the way they did. The teacher showed the student how asking that question was the next step of the cycle.  I feel that I often look at these statistics problems too mathematically in that there is a beginning and an end. Pose the question  collect data  analyze it  and interpret: the end  move to the next problem. Encouraging my students to continue the statistical process is something I really liked and will strive to do in the future.

We do not teach to the test.  Pretest scores usually average around 30% correct and posttest can range from 50-70% correct.  Despite the training on the GAISE goals we give to students weekly for 15 weeks  some of them fail to make the connections to the way questions are asked on the pretest and posttest.  I am sure with the right experience (or the right motivation to actually live the experience we want to give them) they can do better.   It seems hard to give them enough experience in 15 weeks to have the type of thinking needed.  I want to focus on finding out how to motivate them to eat up all the experience they can get in those 15 weeks that I know them.  More than just \you will see this in every aspect of your life\"" but a way that touches them deep inside.  One semester I had a student complete their semester end project using data about a new drug for gum disease who was extremely motivated.  When we discussed why  the student simply said that when speaking with their mother  she said they better learn how to figure out if the drug works because she needed it for her mouth and so do many other people like her.  Sometimes the best motivation does not come from the teacher.  How can we help students to have that type of motivation? """

I love how the various themes in the course are woven together: from the collection of data (observational studies  surveys  and experiments) to data exploration (graphs and statistical measures) to probability models (including sampling distributions) to inference (confidence intervals and hypothesis tests). So my students  at the end of the year  should be able to answer the items in this investigation. But it takes a year (or at least three quarters) to lay the groundwork  to get students to make sense of data  to interpret various measures and to understand statistical significance. My question then is how can this become part of our 7-12 curriculum that is required for all students  so that all students will gain a certain level of statistical literacy? Would one have a 2-3 week unit each year? What would be the progression? Would this be project based or using investigations? Are there course materials out there which we could adopt? And then ... what topics or ideas would be left for a course like AP Statistics?

In 7th grade students begin to think about inferences from samples and study probability and randomness. Bivariate data is the focus of 8th grade. Students look at scatter plots and two-way tables. Common Core Algebra I revisits the univariate data from 6th grade and formalizes the study of bivariate data from 8th grade. In Algebra II  probability is formalized and students begin to make inferences about a sample by looking at simulations. I believe the structure is there to get students prepared for AP Stats or an Intro class in college  but teachers need to be willing to spend the time fully developing these ideas as well as have a strong content knowledge background to see the big picture. I am also interested to see what AP Statistics will look like in the future if students are coming to the course with a strong foundation in statistics.

Also I have noticed that very few math educators what to teach statistics.  When my school started the statistics courses they asked every math teacher if they wanted tot teach it.  They all said no except for myself.  I am not sure why statistics is not liked or taught as well as it should be.

As I teach in a private school  we are not bound by Common Core nor do we always look at what these standards are. Is this what CCSL is? What you have outlined as the structure for preparing students for an introductory class in statistics ... are most teachers actually doing this in practice? As a stat teacher  it seems great  but rather ambitious as it seems that many teachers don't feel prepared to teach this content nor do they feel comfortable with statistical thinking. What would the experts suggest for my situation  where very little statistics is done anywhere outside the 7-12 math classes (except in the dedicated courses). What is done is directed more at computing measures and making graphs  rather than thinking about the context and making conclusions from the data collected that stems from a question that was posed. Where to start?

Furthermore  because of the isolated nature of many schools and curriculums  obvious chances to conduct quantitative science and other approaches that would integrate statistics in a real-world content.

Texas did put probability into the geometry class a year or so ago - but I don't think those kids have filtered through to my class yet.  The last time my students really saw things about central tendency and variation was middle school - so they remember bits and pieces  but yes  stat is a whole new thing for the most part.

And I also get to teach Stats because no one else wants it - the common response to \oh  I teach Statistics\"" is \""Oh  I hated my Stats course in college!\"" I think it comes from not being taught well in the past (as all math and little context) so I'm hoping that by learning more in courses like this I can help turn that around and make Stats something interesting rather than something to avoid!!

I love this post. First of all  students have a hard time calculating the standard deviation by hand ( I usually give them one or two problems like this  but I have them use software to find SD for large data sets.)  let alone having them interpret what they just calculated.  Most importantly    I want my students to understand that not only is the SD the average distance from mean for a given data set  but additionally it is the measure of variation or spread of a data set ( when is it the best measure of variation too.).   I agree that z-scores should be taught as the number of standard deviations that a data value is from the mean.

Kids are simply not experiencing enough contextualized use of math in general  and statistics are another example.  Science teachers  for example  either lack the understanding of the content or the current pedagogical capability to be able to teach quantitive  statical-based science classes.

Thus the course is typically offered in the Summer or online and students are usually not very excited to take the course. It is a challenge given the short time frame (3 weeks or 6 weeks in person or 13 weeks online) to start from the very beginning and move through the material presented with what is usually a very anxious and unmotivated group. However  I would think that many students would be able to answer these types of questions by the end of the course (or at least that is my goal). I am very much looking forward to learning new ways to motivate students (have already thought about how to fit Gapminder into my course)...

We are finding that the quality of student enrolling in AP Stats is declining and that students are enrolling in the class but not taking the AP test.  We do not require that they take the test as part of the class.  The only reason we call the class AP Stats is because we will cover all of the topics needed to succeed on the AP test.

It's the first class where there is space to breathe and reteach concepts without a time crunch.    They resist  but it's really fun to figure out when they start enjoying the course and watch them thrive. We use the Rossman Chance \Workshop Statistics for the Graphing Calculator\"" blue book.

Even today I had them work on an app so they could explore how outliers would impact the correlation coefficient and regression line.  Many of them jumped to the online discussion questions and just tried to find the answers to my questions instead of taking the time to process what they were doing.  Maybe my activity needs to be revised  but sometimes I feel that if their motivation is lacking there is little I can do to help them really understand the material.

This year they no longer offered AP Stat. Our students only get a 2 week unit on statistics in each level 9-12. They can take a course at our  community college but I don't know how our kidsare going to survive a university course. In the past our averge AP kid thought the college level class was tough!!

The Common Core State Standards which intend for students to study statistics from 6th through 12th grades came out and were broadly adopted in 2010. I understand it takes time for educational practice to truly be aligned with the CCSS  but I would like to think the timeline is shorter than 10-20 years. I'm ready for our college introductory statistics classes to start building on what students know about statistics from their K-12 education (and not only from math class! science and social studies also include statistical learning standards) rather than starting back with the basics as if the students don't have this background.

Unfortunately I am preaching to the choir  trying to get more students enrolled.  I have had students tell me whether they have received AP credit or not how much having high school stat has given them an advantage. One student emailed me to let me know he was in BIO in college and they had to construct and interpret confidence intervals and he was the only one that knew what to do!  I am pushing for more than very basic descriptive statistics to be in the curriculum  but they don't want to sacrifice our AP calc scores. Every math course in our district was designed with the goal of taking AP calc junior year/senior year.    I am hoping things change too and soon!

We cover topics beyond what they usually get to in AP Stat so at the start students with AP stat experience are ok with the fast pace and getting a deeper understanding of the foundation.  However as the semester progresses  they do not have much advantage or experience on what we cover (probability distributions  sampling distributions  6 different CI types and 7 hypothesis tests).

Our introductory course does teach some calculations but focuses on the concepts and interpretations. I have had students who have taken AP stats and through conversations I have learned that they enjoyed this class and learned a lot. I do believe that an AP stats course is different than an introductory stats course.

Our AP Stat book covers these topics in Chapters 7 - 12 and are part of the AP curriculum.  Did they have teachers who did not teach those concepts well or rushed through the concepts?  Curious.

I regret that decision to this day because I felt so overwhelmed by my college statistics course and felt like I was behind compared to all my other colleagues. I think they definitely need to implement statistics all throughout the grade levels because there are students out there  who like me  were terrified at the idea of an AP course. A lot of businesses today love to use data to help drive the direction they're going to go in and it's necessary for students to have access to these concepts at a level that they can understand/feel comfortable at. On the plus side  when I did my student teaching 2 years ago  they were teaching statistics in 8th grade which I don't remember doing at all so I'm glad the curriculum is changing!

Students are often times lost when they are asked  for example  to come up with an arithmetic mean.  When a sixth grade curriculum suddenly throws the idea of mean absolute deviation AND the interpretation of this value  they are lost.  I think the problem is that students are not being taught to engage in statistics as a discipline that can provide basis for argumentation in other disciplines.  They are not  in essence  being taught statistical literacy- they are being taught to conduct operations that will yield statistics.  These skills  fi one can be so generous as to call them such  sit in isolation and many times  go no further in the student's skill set.

Years ago  I tried to use SPSS in an introductory statistics course for students in a masters degree level program in policy and management. Back then  before the GUI  students had to write code and use a mainframe campus computer. They spent a great deal of time figuring out their syntax errors rather than learning statistics  and so I stopped. Now  however  there are much-easier-to-use menu-based statistics programs that students can learn to use with little effort  and so I do use one of them (Statistix 10). My students are now undergraduate Business majors and first-year MBA students. The software allows them and me to spend more time getting results and experimenting with different types of summaries and analyses  and less time going through formulas that they are expected to implement either in Excel or on their calculators. I feel that the software alleviates the computational burden and leaves more opportunity for thinking about the choice of method and the results. So  bottom line  if your students can use a menu-based software program like Excel (which I still use for some things)  and if you can find easy-to-use software  then it's definitely feasible to introduce them to statistical software.

One of the community colleges does offer an Introductory Statistics class using R as well as classes who use either StatCrunch or TI-84 calculators. My feeling is that it depends on whom you are teaching too. Most Intro Stats classes are designed for Non-STEM majors and thus are not familiar with programming languages. Thus  it would be quite demanding for the majority of your students to learn R (how to program) as well as learn statistics.   I use Statcrunch which is a window-based web programming language. I find it is easier and cheaper for my students.   One more thing.  Heidi and Thomas bring up a good point about using Excel. I am a mentee in a program funding by NSF and administered by one of the community colleges I teach at ( College of the Canyons) called Tango Stat Ed. In the real world  our students would most likely use Excel over other programs. So a big argument could be made for using this program. However  I asked a statistician  who stated that Excel is inaccurate in some graphs (pie charts) that it calculates.

I took a couple education statistics courses during my doctoral program and we used SPSS in the first one.  Even though it took me a while to figure SPSS out (I always have issues with technology  but Andy Field's book was so helpful) I found SPSS much more helpful than SAS  which is what we used in the second course.  I was frustrated the entire semester for the same reasons you discuss here.  We had to learn how to code (which I did not have experience in) and the focus always seemed to be on what we did wrong (a comma  semi-colon  etc) to figure out why our program wouldn't run.  As an educator  I found myself wondering what the focus for this class <i>should</i> be on - to learn how to code in SAS or to make sense of data analyses. I'm exited to learn more about the statistical software people on these discussion boards have shared!

I think it is important  however  to reinforce the use of z and t tables just so they have the exposure to that visual aspect of it - the symmetry / functionality of the curve  etc.  It's a more tangible way of understanding where those probabilities come from.

I've seen this more this year as I've had more students rely too heavily on technology. I typically have them do everything by hand first  and then at the end of the unit  I teach them the calculator portion. However  after having so many students relying so heavily on their calculators this year  I'm considering not teaching them the calculator commands until after they take the test on each unit. I have noticed a pretty substantial difference in how well they understand normal and t-distributions  as well as how well they understand the meaning of a z-score and a p-value. (They tend to get the interpretations of these mixed up when they're doing entire hypothesis tests on their calculators.)

I'd like students to know where these numbers come from. I usually provide a simple data set where hand calculation is manageable for standard deviation  5 number summary  etc  then have them graph a box and whisker plot manually. I also show them how to find all these numbers and graph on TI-Nspire. When I do a project  I give them a choice of using the TI or online grapher.   California recently switched their state testing from a scantron test (STAR) to computerized test (smarter balance). In STAR test  students were not allowed to use a calculator but they always asked to find standard deviation by hand. Smarter balance provides online calculator and desmos graphing now  so I think perhaps things have changed in the last couple of years. But I still would like students to see the manual calculation without a calculator.

Anyone remember the groundbreaking Statistics textbook by Freedman  Pisani  Purves and Adhikari? So this course follows in its footsteps. It seeks to take away the calculations and computations and give students the idea of drawing conclusions from sampling distributions by using the bootstrap method. Students actually do a little computer programming  but no traditional calculating  and use big data sets. Students use their laptop and Berkeley seems to have given tools for visualizing the process. It's really statistical reasoning and thinking in action!

If they are only in 11th grade and haven't taken the SAT yet  I'll use their PSAT scores and just add the 0.  We use the data in a variety of ways throughout the year  but around now we use it as part of the unit on inference about the difference in means.  I have students investigate questions such as  \Do students in AP math classes do better on the SAT-M than on the SAT-V?\"" (and vice versa for AP English students).  And  \""Do students in AP math do better on the SAT-M than AP English students do on the SAT-M?\"" (again  and vice versa for the SAT-V). Some years yield significant results  but most years do not (usually p-values around .2 or .3).  This investigation leads us to rich discussions about the validity of our results (maybe some kids are just good at school and therefore good at everything)  independent groups (are there some kids who take both AP math and AP English?)  and how I could have collected my data in a better manner (maybe separate kids and only compare kids who only take one AP class  either math or English  but not both).  Anyway  it seems to work well and the kids seem to enjoy it because it's their data.  They look around the room and speculate about who may have been to one who had unusually high scores  etc.     """

What is your class size?     I like this example best out of the three for high school / intro because it goes from start to finish  especially with the way Lorraine conducts this lesson at the start.  The other two have data already there for students so they are only focusing on interpreting the results (something I am stuck with for my class of 300+ students - even with one TA there is no way to collaborate having students pick a research question  collect data and analyze it  let alone go through the grading  even with peer review).

We design the experiment together and talk about the random assignment of the odd ball drink in which cup  consistency in pouring  color  smell  how to blind the experiment  ect.  We then look at our data and compare it to a simulation to see if we have more \skill\"" than randomly guessing.  This helps create a smoother transition between simulations and experiments.  I have also used different drinks  most recently blue Gatorade vs Blue Powerade.  Smell and color were factors we had trouble controlling.    """

If I had to deal with that and really wanted them to be able to follow the cycle I'd probably try to put them into groups of 4 - 5  and grade the work from the group.  You're still looking at 60-80 things to grade  but that's a heck of a lot better than 300.  And if you have them turn in each part of the cycle at different times the grading gets a little easier.  I generally have classes of about 20  so I haven't tried that (thankfully!) but I was the TA for a Calc 1 course of similar size.  If your students spend any time with the TA in a smaller setting  like lab sections  you could have the TA do that kind of thing during those times.  Things like this take a bit more time and planning on the instructors part  but can be more rewarding  I think.  Plus a system that does some online grading for you is always great!

Also  if a group has experience with collecting data  that's great; if not  you might have trouble collecting valid data.  As most of us teaching in middle level classes would attest  a statistics uint is usually covered as part of a math class  by non-stats people.  As a result  coverage becomes an issue.  Therefore  using various tools like the ones we've seen in this course so far becomes very important.  So the collection of the data might look different- instead of actually collecting survey results  maybe a student is going to correlate surveys on-line from various sources.  Still allowing the student to collect information  this approach will likely speed up the process and make it far more realistic in the context of coverage demands.

This is a real problem for many teachers.  I teach a Community College evening statistics course and class size varies quite a bit.  One thing that I find works if you want to assign a task that covers all four phases of the cycle...Pose  Collect  Analyze  and Interpret  is to give a task that requires students to do most of the time-consuming stuff outside of the class itself.  For example  I assign a task that involves looking at all the information on a cereal box and discussing in class what ingredients in the cereal might most affect the unit price.  Of course many students choose to consider sugar vs unit price but if you encourage the class to look further other ingredients such as a certain vitamin or natural flavorings come to mind.  Also older evening division students tend to categorize cereals as healthy types  fun types  etc.  Anyway  in the class students pose a question and discuss gathering data.  The time-consuming work of checking out at least 20 types of cereal in the marked and recording unit price vs. ingredient content (grams  etc.) is done outside class.  Students must bring a data sheet into the next class and analyze and interpret their data with StatCrunch and then hand in the final report with conclusions.  I don't dictate that they use a linear regression analysis but most do as that is the topic we are covering at the time.

Thinking about preparing the students for the AP Test  they do need to be able to answer this question; however  it is a lower level thinking question and is one that won't require much teacher guidance or discussion amongst students.   2) Coke vs. Pepsi - I think this activity could be improved by proposing to the students how can we design an experiment to determine if Coke or Pepsi is better.  Then try to guide them to the proposed design.  Carry out the experiment and then have them determine which one is better using whatever method they can.   3) Television Time - I think the only improvement that could be made to this one is perhaps the raw data should be provided to the students and they need to determine which graph to use.    Overall thought - I understand the importance of having the students play with data and figure out the story  but I have to teach them the basic skills to pass the AP Test.

Rather than change a task  my inclination is to complete and then extend each task. The Airport Passengers task is fairly simple  and though students might have some difficulty with the scale of the dot plot  the questions that are asked can be answered with the table alone. To improve this activity it might be useful to ask students in what way they think the data would look different in 2017  and if there are airports that should be on the list now. This would be a good opportunity for students to do some research and collect their own data  which is easy when almost every student has access to the Internet in their pocket. The Television Time task currently allows for more latitude in the interpretation of results and requires an explanation. After completing this task  students could extend the activity it by measuring and reporting their own television time (or time spent on their phones) and perhaps  comparing it to their grade average in their classes.   The Old Faithful Activity is my favorite statistical task of the three  but not just because it does the best job of engaging students in statistics throughout the investigation cycle. I also like it because it is poses a real-life problem that anyone who has visited  or now wants to visit  Yellowstone National Park! There are also other questions that can arise from the data. I found myself questioning the data. For instance  I quickly checked the total minutes of non-activity during Day 1 and predicted the average length of time of geyser activity  which led to a Google search where I found that the duration of the geyser can be between three to ten minutes  which led me to think of a possible connection between the length of time between the activity and the length of time of the activity  etc. Hopefully the activity helps students want to investigate further...

Students are not allowed to craft their own statistical questions and be immersed in the data. They are simply told to either analyze the data in a certain way or asked a very direct question. In other words  they are not considering the context for themselves but through another person's eyes. In an office  they are the fact checkers and calculators  rather than the designers and engineers. They given a task to fulfill rather than the opportunity to anticipate variability  be skeptical of the data  or make sense of the data along the way. Task #2 allows students to wade around in the data and make sense of it. They collaborate with one another  to interpret the data  to figure out the best way to represent the data.  Tasks #1 and #3 can be improved. Task #1 could ask students to collect their own data regarding airports. The students could either answer the given question at a broader level or come up with their own questions. Task #3 could also be more worthwhile if students collected information about their class and students in another class. Instead of telling the students to make a dot plot  it could be their own choice.

I have often argued that science and math need to be taught as one subject; I'm not sure that I haven't changed my argument- that statistics and science should be completely linked.

As we were being briefed about the CPM book  it was brought up about this book incorporates much more reading and writing into the math curriculum.  As a stats teacher  I know we need more of this because my students in stats can not write down their thoughts.  It is very difficult for students to communicate about mathematical ideas because they have been trained in rules and algorithms.  Stats exploits this weakness and makes it very difficult  for students.  Many teachers also fall into this catagory which is another reason it is so difficult to staff a stats class.  Is anyone else seeing these same issues?

I like having clear cut answers to my clear cut questions.  However  I know that when I teach I encourage  students to come up with multiple solution strategies and I see this ambiguity as something related to that.  My preservice teachers have told me repeatedly that they would prefer me to teach by showing them an example and giving them time to follow the exact same steps.  We want our K-12 students to be creative and come up with solution strategies that make sense to them  so I feel like we need to prepare future teachers to be comfortable with this idea.  However  it took me years (of struggling through it) to be able to do this  and I feel like I'm continuing to learn every day.     One of the experts suggested we need to be \okay\"" with the ambiguity and realize everything depends on the context.  Also  we have to be willing to embrace uncertainty  which I know is difficult for me.  On the other hand  when we discuss what data has been collected  the variables that were chose  possible responses  etc  we are helping students understand what their results are telling them. I know that like teaching anything else  there is a learning curve to student errors/misconceptions  but how long has it taken some of you to really feel comfortable teaching Statistics?    """

Been there!  One thing that helped me was to choose a very rich data set that has multiple variables in it.  ANd I spent lots of time playing with the data myself so I could at least anticipate some of the issues that might come up and have some pre-ideas of what trends and patterns (or not) may exist in the data.   Doing this gave me real comfort that I KNEW the context and the nuances that may be in the data....but of course my students always brought new ideas to the table and often had DIFFERENT contextual understandings of the context than I had (based on their own world experiences with the context).    Would love to hear from others on this idea of becoming comfortable with ambiguity and uncertainty.

I am at the point now where I can answer any question the students throw at me  most of the time.  And I am comfortable going in the direction that students lead with their questions.  That wasn't always true.  So...now to quantify the time.  5 years for most topics  but there are still some topics that I struggle with - power is one of them.

Sure  there are basic steps you can follow like the scientific method of posing a question  collecting data  etc.  but along the way  you need to try different methods and looking at different perspectives. And that's scary. But it ultimately teaches our kids real-life skills since most real-life problems cannot be solved with an algorithm. That's why they are problems.

Either you did it right or not  no room for interpretation (for the most part).  However with Statistics  everything depends on something... the question  the data  the method used to collect the data  the test being used to make conclusions... There are some cut and dry options within these  but for the most part it is how the person wants to approach the topic.  I think it is us as teachers that have the bigger issue not the students.  The willingness to accept a multitude of different answers and considering them all correct with their unique justifications is hard.  For example the video on the name Jane  all of those are acceptable responses to the question at hand.  Are some more rooted in mathematics  of course... Are some better than others  absolutely... So how do you give a grade... That is the hard part...  I find that rubrics are a good way of going about this... it helps us &amp; them figure a good approach  an idea of our expectations and a justification for the given grade.       It takes a while to get used to this method and it is always a work in progress... you just more comfortable over time... but the more you use it  the less time it takes...

My background is in statistics (teaching it is secondary) and we are trained from day 1 that there is no one right answer. There are many good answers  perhaps a best answer. I also convey that to my students from day 1 - that sets me up for success - when students come up with a solution I hadn't thought of it's another opportunity to convey that there is so much to learn from data.     I also agree that having robust data set makes it less intimidating  as it's easier to see that there are many ways to interpret the data and tease out information.

Although the College Board says that a graphing calculator is required  they aren't giving it to the students to use.  So  to keep things equitable there needs to be a way to do things without a graphing calculator.  However  students with a graphing calculator can have an advantage over students who do not for doing things like confidence intervals and hypothesis testing.    If you also look at previous exams  when data is based on a large data set or data with many digits  graphs are already given to the students to interpret.  Calculations and using the calculator are actually a very small part of the exam.  I would argue interpreting and drawing conclusions are emphasized more.

This is a real problem for many teachers.  I teach a Community College evening statistics course and class size varies quite a bit.  One thing that I find works if you want to assign a task that covers all four phases of the cycle...Pose  Collect  Analyze  and Interpret  is to give a task that requires students to do most of the time-consuming stuff outside of the class itself.  For example  I assign a task that involves looking at all the information on a cereal box and discussing in class what ingredients in the cereal might most affect the unit price.  Of course many students choose to consider sugar vs unit price but if you encourage the class to look further other ingredients such as a certain vitamin or natural flavorings come to mind.  Also older evening division students tend to categorize cereals as healthy types  fun types  etc.  Anyway  in the class students pose a question and discuss gathering data.  The time-consuming work of checking out at least 20 types of cereal in the marked and recording unit price vs. ingredient content (grams  etc.) is done outside class.  Students must bring a data sheet into the next class and analyze and interpret their data with StatCrunch and then hand in the final report with conclusions.  I don't dictate that they use a linear regression analysis but most do as that is the topic we are covering at the time. </div></div></div></div>   """

I teach block classes which gives me additional time in class to work through experiments. However  I think  independent data collecting is an important skill that not only saves class time  but also gives our students experience finding appropriate data from online sources. As with anything  finding a balance between hands on data collection and independent research is the best way to ensure that our students are capable of both skills.

I taught a class of 50+ this past semester and at the very least I would pass around a physical sign-in sheet  but instead of having them indicate if they were present or not  they would (hopefully) answer one or more questions that I pose  for example:  1. Given a picture of my house and some details about it  how much would they pay to rent it?  (Data was self-serving as I was considering how much to charge for rent  but students helped me advertise important amenities/restrictions).  2.  Based on an NPR report about online loan applicants and associated variables for repayment default  students answered two questions (1) the last time they bought gas  did they pay at the pump or pay inside and (2) do they smoke.  (The report said there was a hypothesis that those that paid inside were more likely to smoke -- we tested the hypothesis using class data.)  This brought up questions of response/nonresponse bias as well.

When I began to chew on this a bit more  I realized there are two ways to do this.  One would be to think about what could cause an outlier (this assumes that the measurement is correct and valid.)  The other would be to examine if the measurement process caused the outlier (this  arguing the inverse of the previous proposition.)  I almost see this as a logical continuation of ones understanding of outliers.  First  what causes a value to be an outlier?  Why do things grow differently?  Why might one family have a significantly higher income that those who they live near?  The second task  to examine if ones measurement practices were valid and the data that those practices yielded was reliable  seems to be a more complex task  that one might not see until later on in high school or at a college level.

She remembers how to test the difference between two groups and something about regression  but there are so many variables here  not just the two she worked with in class.</em>  <strong>(1) Barriers and Threats</strong> The course that we have been teaching is rapidly becoming irrelevant. Most of our students will not be statisticians  so we hope to teach them to think statistically. But how do statisticians think? One important component is that we deal with several‚Äîsometimes many‚Äîvariables at once  and we use computers to deal with large amounts of data. Yet  after a full year  AP students have hardly been exposed to any analyses with more than two variables or a few hundred cases.  We are told that it isn‚Äôt practical or affordable for statistics classes to use computers  but the fastest-growing AP course last year was Computer Science  where students work regularly on computers.  <strong>(2) Opportunities</strong> There is no reason to link the AP Statistics course to a particular piece of outdated technology. The AP Computer Science and the future Computer Principles courses use ‚Ä¶ computers. Open-source statistical software is readily available and becoming increasingly easy to use and master. Students who lack access to computers can at least learn to read and understand output from common statistics software.  The main impediment to implementing changes to the AP Statistics course is that most of the teachers have never actually done a statistical analysis and  thus  prefer to emphasize the small sample  computational  and probabilistic topics in the curriculum rather than statistical modeling. Let‚Äôs free the AP course from its technological and probabilistic shackles and rethink a course in statistical thinking and modeling better suited for the 21st century. ************************************ """

I am curious as to what schools are doing AP Computer courses.  Are they the lowest SES schools?  Would the College Board or some generous donor be willing to give computers to those schools (and update them frequently) to make sure these technology-based courses can be taught in a relevant way?  Another barrier is testing.  My husband is a chemistry professor at Lafayette College and says that one part of the AP Chem exam that he doesn't like is that it doesn't test lab skills.  How would we test computer skills for statistics on the AP exam?  We kind of do that now by having students read generic output.  But reading output is very different than producing that output.  The project described at the beginning of the scenario would need advanced statistical techniques to analyze.  I am guessing she would need at least a minor in statistics to do what is being required of her correctly.

That happens when there are a total of 30 rolls.  So  n = 100 is definitely large enough  because the expected value would then be 16 and 2/3 for each value of the die.

They nicely settled on multiples of 6 for a sample size and increased the number of rolls (keeping the multiple of 6) for more convincing evidence. I love how you can do quite a few number of rolls in a very short time!  So I decided to try 6000 rolls of a die using the Fathom tool. A couple of observations for the High Rollers company die with actual probabilities: P(1) = 13.33% P(2) = 20% P(3) = 13.33% P(4) = 20% P(5) = 13.33% and P(6) = 20%.    1) The results take time to show up. About 5 minutes. But in the meantime  it's great to see the dynamic changing of the bars as more rolls are completed. (Keep animation on.) As you surpass 3000 rolls  the bars really start to settle down so that it almost appears that there is NO CHANGE. However  it does continue to change.   2) Fathom shows two bar charts  one with frequencies on the y-axis and one with relative frequencies. Interesting to compare the two. The first continually has to change the scale whereas the second keeps the scale constant. Do the percentages get closer to the theoretical percentages with number of rolls? Yes  although it never stopped at exactly 20% (or 13.33%). How about the counts? Will the counts get closer to the expected counts? I'm not sure whether this difference will tend to increase or decrease with number of rolls. Holly?  3) The simulation with 6000 rolls shows clear differences between rolling a 1 3 5 and rolling 2 4 6. However  the bars while \somewhat\"" the same for 1 3 5  were not exactly the same height. Variation again raising its ugly head. I think the math teacher in me wanted to see the theoretical percentages showing up!  """

You can calculate the P-value for any number of trials beyond 30  technically  but should also look deeper and evaluate the graphical displays too  to help make a decision.

It seems like my students are generally willing to discuss in pairs  but are more hesitant when it comes to sharing with the class. One approach that I got from a workshop recently is called the \rotating salesman\""  where one person from each group gets to present their groups' findings to another group. By having them process this information more  it seems like they are more likely to understand more of what they are doing  then you can assess them with some form of online quiz or exit ticket. """

The class time is used for homework problems and hand on activities done in student assigned groups.    I still struggle with letting my students investigate the material and learn the material by doing it.

It primes their brain receptors to know what language they will encounter and what to anticipate in the upcoming class.  I teach at a two-year college.  Some of my students still have dial-up internet service so they are at a disadvantage when I ask students to watch a video before coming to class.  If all students have a study hall where they could watch the video  then the flipped classroom idea will work  otherwise (as mentioned) the disadvantaged students are hindered.  Many of my lessons are activity and small group driven.  To help provide some guidance to the activity  ensure students are recording their thoughts and calculations  and to provide myself an assessment each day I have a worksheet with several questions on it.  Students have to finish the worksheet either in class or by the start of the next class.  Students still have homework outside of class to ensure they have learned the concepts  but they are expected to do just a few problems.

They do not take much time allowing students to use the majority of the class for the investigation and discussion.

Our solution to \kids who shouldn't be in AP\"" is to move them to my on-level stat class - we are lucky to be able to offer both classes.   One thing that somewhat works is anything that tags back to games or cell-phones.  I got kids to actually collect data using Tiger-Stat - and then when they did that they actually got somewhat interested in doing the number crunching.  Cell-phones are normally discouraged  so anything where they get to use their cell-phone for a timer gets them going.  I'm trying to figure out a way to let them play games on the phones  collect scores and then use the scores for data.   I hate using sports examples  but that will get the athletes involved (I actually saw a light go on when we talked about using the binomial distribution to figure out probabilities for making some number of free throws out of some number of shots.

I decided to try the Schoolopoly.  I had a lot of activities for that first day  so I didn't blow out the activity (i.e. with posters  etc.) as on the instruction sheet.  Also  due to time I only had 1 group of 4 students investigate each die.  I had each group send one representative to the front of the room and share their conclusions.  I have two sections and I had 6 groups in each class (1 die per group).  I felt that most of my students would realize they needed to look at multiple rolls  before they made a decision.  There was 1 group in each class that only looked at 10 rolls.  I questioned them on this logic in their group and guided them to realize they needed to look at more than 10 rolls.  Overall  it was a good activity and I think I will use it again.  My only real issue was that I had to use the Geogebra as it was the only free option and there is a bug in the Geogebra.  Some of the smarter students figured out the bug  but others didn't.  It seems as if you have to click on and off your die if you change the number of rolls  otherwise  it always seemed to default to one set outcome.

It seems that we teach many of the statistical habits of mind in AP Statistics. We try to use simulations and sometimes dynamic software to develop conceptual understanding before doing formal inference. If we don't have the software (or maybe as a precursor)  we will do simulations with pennies or cards or chips.   At the end of the AP course  we teach about eight different inference procedures using means and proportions. Always the data sets are limited and the question usually is formulated for the student. When looking at real life  are these tests (one and two sample Z tests for proportions  one and two sample t tests for means  chi square goodness of fit  homogeneity and independence  lin reg t test for slope) actually used? On occasion  the biology teacher has asked me to help with a statistical analysis. I often think that I don't have the right tool or procedure for her (since my knowledge is largely limited by the curriculum of the AP course and none of the eight procedures seem to fit). I feel less like the resident statistics expert at this point. Is the AP curriculum outdated? Or is it really that it is just an introduction?   As a related question  I have been reading about Data Science courses (like the one at Berkeley) and Data Analytics degrees. Are these really synonymous with Statistics or is this really something different? Maybe a different way of thinking?    Bottom line  I would like to be able to have an understanding beyond that of what I teach.

I tell my students to compare it to reading.  We are reading at the elementary level at this point  perhaps up to the 5th grade level.  We have a long way to go to read great works of literature and a long way to go to get to advanced statistical techniques.    The good news is that most statistical techniques are sampling distributions and calculating a p-value.   Even if students don't know the statistical procedure that was used in a research paper that they read in the future  they will see p-values and they will know how to draw conclusions from them.

We often don't spend enough time discussing why the formula works or how it was derived.  As far as stats goes  not enough time in class is dedicated to speculating and analyzing the data.  We typically just crunch the numbers and move on.  That is something we  as teachers  need to focus on to help our students understand what the numbers mean.

At the middle school  it is entirely appropriate to think about \is MARS candy telling the truth about the color distribution of M&amp;Ms\""  have student collect data  and try to come up with some evidence on whether it is or isn't. In reality those students are creating null hypotheses and doing the foundational work for inference testing they will learn down the road.

Also  I like the fact that there are so many options for analysis. Students could work to develop their own questions. or could look at data to analyze questions that I have created. It gives the teacher lots of options for differentiating instruction based on students level of understanding and familiarity with statistics.

Eventually they will settle on something and everyone can contribute to the brainstorming process.  (Although they have conversations around ideas in English and history  they are not used to doing this in math and will look to the teacher for the \right\"" answer.)  So as to not take up too much time in class  the brainstorming could happen over google docs with each student writing their ideas in a different color of text.  This could serve as a homework assignment over a weekend or over a few days.  When they come to class  they should be able to come to consensus on a question in just 10 minutes or so. """

Once I figured it out  I started thinking about questions I wanted to know. For instance  what gender do most of the texting. No surprise there! The more I played with the data  the more questions I developed. The data was just for the US but then I began wondering if results would be different in other countries. I think students would need time to look at the data that is available and then generate questions. I think collecting the data may be difficult at the middle level. I would probably need some additional help from a statistician to make sure that the data is clean. Students at the middle level are just beginning to work on graphing options. From our readings it was pretty clear that students need a lot of support at this. Not only is make the graphs a new concept  so is interpreting. These students are pretty concrete -but if the focus is on something they want to know and understand  there would need to be some level of success in the process.

When I requested a sample size of 10 for middle school students in Hawaii  no data was available. After some searching  it looks like the only information available from Hawaii is from one high school class. I hope that my students would be able to discover this as well and see that the data is definitely not representative of the entire state of Hawaii. This should spark a conversation about the data collection method.  The other missing piece of data lies in the gender question. Students are only able to answer Male or Female to that question. There could be missing data if someone does not identify as either gender.  This reminds me of the Gender Equality project in conjunction with The World's Largest Lesson that people should check out. It's like the Census at School  because it is based on self-reported data from around the world. The difference is that the questions focus on the gender ratio in different regions.  https://worldslargestlesson.globalgoals.org/FromWhereIStand/index.html

It sounds like a stupid question  as attention is supposed to be kept by more engaging activities  but the classes I've been working with happened to think that \""engaging and not standard\"" meant \""not the mathematics we are used to\""  which for them meant \""we are not going to study this stuff cause its not a real test\"".

I do not seem to be able to explain to my seniors and the guidance department of my high school that almost every student that continues onto a 2 or 4 year college needs the course.  I can only get a few students at the high school level and college level to comprehend statistics.  Most of them just remember how to do the work with out comprehension of what they are trying to solve.  They still get good grades but they do not retain anything when the finish the course.  I give tons of projects but most of the time the students only give minimal effort.

It is frustrating  but I persist.  Early morning classes don't help.  If carrots (ie.  extra credit on projects) don't work  then resort to sticks.  Each class assignment gets graded.  For example  we collectively do a CLT demonstration and subsequently use the results to calculate confidence intervals.  This is graded as a quiz.  I'm about to start a real  SASI-based project this week.    I'll have the students in groups working on a large data set they are familiar with.  But how to break the ice?  Certainly  I'll review the data set and the survey questions.  I like Heidi's idea of showing the videos on transportation time &amp; mode to demonstrate the process of posing questions etc..  I'll stress visual investigation first  numerical second as suggested in the intro video to this section.  And as many of you suggested  I'll be walking around  guiding  prodding  engaging!.  I plan to have this project graded as part of the  exam 2 weeks away(maybe 25%).  As part of the preparation   I'll ask each student what question they posed and how they plan to proceed.

I usually do this activity with various levels of force and measuring the distances travelled by the projectile by the various settings on the \ cannon \"" .

That is  they don't consider how what they are doing relates to the bigger picture of what we're studying in the current unit.  While they stay physically engaged (going through the motions  and even enjoying it)  they don't stay mentally engaged (trying to draw conclusions or make connections).  I think both your issue and mine can be at least partially addressed by asking the students to independently do some problems or answer some questions on the skill the activity was supposed to address after doing the activity but before debriefing it.  This requires each student to try to apply what they've learned even if it hasn't been explicitly taught yet.  If students know they will be required to turn in something like this (which could be graded on thoughtfulness of responses rather than completely on accuracy)  then after a while they will figure out that they need to stay engaged (physically and mentally) during the activity.  In a perfect world students wouldn't need this external motivation but we all know that  unfortunately  many of them do.  """

They didn't want canned examples about pepsi/coke or height/weight. They wanted examples about corn yields  commercial flight times and delays  patient satisfaction  etc. I've altered my teaching to suit this desire and found much higher engagement.

It is always difficult for me to ensure that students are pulling out the important mathematical content from the activity the are engaged in. I love the idea of a questioning portion before a debriefing.

Our district has a rule that no one assignment ban be more than 20% of a student's grade (AP classes get an exception on this).  So I do two unit tests and a project for major grades.   This last two years the problem seems to have gotten worse about kids not doing projects.  The original intent (aside from conforming to the rules) was to give kids who don't test well an alternative way to show what they've learned.    At least I know I'm not alone in the problem.

I like the projects because it gives me a chance to help students refine their thinking on an individual basis  and they have the freedom to choose their data set.

We don't have that many and the ones we do have are put on posterboard for a one day gallery walk.  Half the class stands by their posters and gives a mini presentation about their work  answering questions etc.  Then  halfway through the class period we switch.  Those that were walking around are now presenting and vice versa.  The fact that they are presenting to their peers ups the accountability.  They don't want to be known as the one that didn't do the project.

They will have to know how to interpret their data  and we can't teach them how to do that if we always give them nice clean data.

In Italy  where I currently work  statistics is kind of an added-on topic to calculus (we generally talk about \mathematics\"" and statistics is a particular topic inside mathematics  usually taught with calculus methods. In the elementary school some good work is done with children  but nearly all of it gets lost as they go towards higher grades of education. I think the idea of teaching stats before calculus and showing that calculus is useful and to be used FOR stats  and not viceversa  is even more revolutionary in Italy and I'd hope there were more resources like these in our teaching environment too.

Calculus usually needs to follow directly after a Precalculus course.   A Stats class sandwiched in between the 2 would cause most students to forget the Precalculus material.  The hardest part is figuring out how to best allow kids to take both courses.  Stats as a senior after ap calc makes taking ap calc early a moot point.  Taking stats prior to ap calc presents the problems listed above.  You almost have to choose one or the other to make either be beneficial in the long run.

This was brought up in the earlier video with the expert panel. As we think about where stats fits into the curriculum  integrating it with other courses will seem to reinforce concepts. But again  the role that standardized assessments have in guiding curriculum will also have a say in this.

We only require that students pass advanced algebra before taking AP Stats.  What we have found is that students that do not get better than a C+ in Diff Advanced Algebra usually do poorly in AP Stats.  Now this is Advanced Placement  not regular stats.  So what we have started doing in our school is offering regular stats also.  We are a large school  1860 students  block schedule  and typically have about 5 sections of AP stats with about 25-30 in each class.  We would lose about 25%-30% of these students due to withdrawing or failures from the class being too difficult.   We are hoping that counselors will look more carefully at past grades and place students appropriately into AP or regular.  What has also been a challenge is that few of our teachers want to teach stats.  Currently there are two of us that teach stats on a block schedule.  We are hoping to expand that number also.  As far as order of classes taken  being on a block schedule allows us the luxury of having students take it whenever they want because their schedules are more flexible.  They can take pre-calc and calc back to back and still have room for stats.  As a math department  we have gotten better at identifying what is best by having teachers look at each of their students schedule for the next year and have their teacher advise what they take and not the counselors.  I know this sounds really weird but if we don't  we have too many misplaced students.  As a teacher  I spend way more time with an individual student than the counselor and have a better feel for what they are capable of doing.  It takes a lot of our time but we are finding many benefits with helping with the scheduling.

What the statistics is telling us is more important in most US professions than the why.  Pure mathematicians don't like that approach but the workforce is changing rapidly and wants those that can understand and  those that can interpret well. I still find the Mathematics to be important but can't argue with those that don't absolutely need the why.

Maybe through seeing how it is different and possibly more relevant to their future  students will see the benefit of taking a statistics course to further their understanding.  It seems that Calculus is pushed on math students and Statistics is viewed as just an extra that some students who have an interest in math should take.

Another option is to let the student to grade each other. Give the group so many points and let them award them accordingly.

This has helped with the situation you described of being resentful of a particular weak group member  as the stronger students won't always be pulling the struggling student's weight. I don't think it's the perfect solution  but it's worked ok for me in the past.

One is to have groups submit work whereby each student was given a different color pen and all of the colors need to be present on all submitted group work.     There are also more simplistic cooperative strategies  such as giving each students a couple of paperclips.  Each time they contribute to the group discussion  they get to put one of their paperclips into the \bin.\""  The goal is that no one has any paperclips left at the end of the activity.  Additionally  I will occasionally have students rate their group participation on a scale of 1 to 4 on a note card and submit it to me.  If I agree  I will circle the number.  If I do not agree  I will write the number I feel is appropriate and offer a short anecdotal note as to why I disagree.  Sometimes kids think they are participating with quality discussion points  but they really are not.  They need to know why what they are contributing is not high level feedback.  """

I too change my groups up rather frequently. When I change the groups I will either group by:   <ul><li>similar ability students in the same groups</li><li>a mixture of abilities</li><li>convenience grouping by where students selected their seat for the day </li><li>as students walk in the room they select a card from a modified standard deck of cards. All the students with 9's are grouped together. </li><li>students self select</li></ul> I find by changing the groups the dynamics in the group do not become stagnant  I am surprised by which groupings are more effective than I would have expected  students that are good 'teachers' stand out  and vocabulary becomes consistent throughout the entire classroom.  I too have tried to assign roles to students. Such as leader  recorder  reporter  etc. I did not find much success with this. The natural leaders still lead. I too like the paperclip idea.

I typically encourage students to work together  but it is unguided.  I learned a structured group activity:  About 3-5 minutes before the end of class  ask each student to write about something they learned on the day's topic (or they may write a question they have on the topic). Then  in small groups (2-3)  I will ask them to share what they wrote.  As the students are sharing  I plan to walk around and listen.  This is done at the end of class and the paper on which they write their item becomes their exit ticket. I review their items and get an idea what to review next time.

Sometimes kids work better with their friends or with other kids that are on the same ability level as them. I also like to put kids in groups of 2-3. I think groups of 4 are too big  because there's not much for kids to work on when the group is too big.

The lady said she would watch the groups and then would put the \stragglers\"" together  so that they could not rely on the smarter students to do the work for them. In addition to having roles for each member  I also liked a strategy of picking one person from each group for a \""huddle\"" in which the teacher shares information with them and then they have to report back to their group.

After reading your list  I realized that I  have used the same methods  (with the exception of choosing cards from a deck  which I think is a great idea). But what I also realized is that I do not always switch my grouping methods regularly  and instead I tend to stay with one or two methods that seem to work best. I need to make a concerted effort to switch strategies regularly  which would then create different opportunities for leadership and collaboration.

73,Teaching Statistics Through Data Investigations - Fall 2017,860,Investigate and Discuss,18382,On Unit 1 and the quiz,14670,14670,NULL,0,17/09/12 19:27:14,50387,On Unit 1 and the quiz," In Unit 1 we are asked to consider the students we work with  how well prepared they are to answer the questions that were in the quiz  and what would we need to assist them in this task.  In the case of my students  several statistical concepts need to be presented and reaffirmed  such as requiring that a sample be representative  knowing the difference between the various types of scientific studies and their characteristics  and so on. The students in my class design  carry out  and report on an experimental study related to human physiology  working in small teams.  In the beginning they are relatively ill-prepared in these topics. However  in addition to my previous teaching methods and resources I plan to incorporate the materials and strategies that we will see in this course. For instance  the Gapminder and LOCUS web pages  seem to be very useful aids.  Concerning the quiz  I found the questions interesting and had little trouble answering all of them  except for number 1. For that reason I flagged it. And in the end I selected an \incorrect\"" answer (option \""a\""). The point I want to raise for discussion here is that the question asked for <span lang=\""EN-US\"">the most appropriate way to learn about the opinions of adult citizens on the issue at hand. I think that from the statistical point of view  there is no better study than a census  since the whole population is considered and the true population parameters can be found. I am aware that this approach may result prohibitively costly  but that is the only reason why it would be \""inappropriate\"". Further  a sample may provide estimators that are in close agreement with the population values. But this may not always be the case  due to sampling error (which can be bounded)  and also to the possibility of bias. Thus  sampling may result inappropiate too.</span>  <span lang=\""EN-US\"">I'll be looking forward to reading comments from you. Many thanks.</span>  <span lang=\""EN-US\""> </span> """

However  I think that this would be difficult to execute.  When one considers cost and the difficulty of getting \everyone\"" to provide an opinion.  Time could also be a factor.  While an online survey or even a quick in person opinion poll may not seem too labor intensive  getting 100%  participation or fairly close may prove to be quite difficult.  I also agree with you about the need to introduce several of the statistical concepts from the quiz to my students with continued reinforcement.  At this point many of them have not been exposed to these concepts.          """

You are right  even though a census should provide the most complete and accurate information  there are many obstacles to consider when performing one  such as the ones you describe. Having enough money to do it would help to deal with some of them  but others may still persist.

The point that Regina made is also valid.  If one is looking to lessen the amount of error  the cost in both money and employee time to do so may not be cost-effective.  The example I give my students is that a supervisor (without knowledge of how surveys and/or sampling works) may want a high confidence level but the cost to do so may be prohibitive.

I think my students would somewhat struggle  with question 5 since it deals with an observational study and causation and  probably/introduction to hypothesis testing would need to be covered for  question 8.      The questions that would give my students the most trouble  would be 3  4  and 7.  Students would  need to have a good understanding of variability (standard deviation)/the  Empirical rule for question 4 and I think it is hard for students to interpret  standard deviation in a real world context.

It is clear that the difficulty of the individual items on the quiz will vary depending on the groups of students that would attempt to answer them  on their background regarding the study of statistics  and so on.   For instance  you think that your students would find item 1 to be easy  while I had doubts about it (see my post related to this issue). And I can only assume that the same would happen with my students.

Some of the questions in the pre-assessment require the students to have an understanding of variability and their ability to analyze what that information means.  My students would not understand how to calculate using the Empirical rule and neither did I understand how to do that.  I think my student would understand the question that was an observational study because using the scientific methods in science they would see that they were observing a behavior that was presented to them.

Standard deviation seems to be a difficult topic for my students to understand.  I am happy that we are beginning to introduce the topic earlier  but not so happy about the modified empirical rule my department head wants us to use.  It is rounded and somewhat simplified.  The purpose of was to reduce the challenge of the mathematics.  My students would also need an introduction to the topics.  I am not certain they would have identified the observational study but I am certain that they could easily pick up the concept with a little instruction and exposure.  Causation is a concept that we have also started introducing at an earlier age.   We introduce this with correlation.  After taking the quiz  I started explicitly teaching the idea of creating hypotheses.  I have also discovered that the AP Bio students are familiar with hypotheses including null hypotheses.    Gapminder and Locus seem like they will be useful tools.  I think that Locus will help provide some sample questions and responses that would assist the members of our Mathematics Department in reaching a level of comfort with teaching statistics.  The sample responses would assist in the instructors understanding of the expectations for meeting the standards.   Also they will assist in providing instructional model answers for the students which helps to clarify expectations for their performance as well.

The way I wrap it around in my head is from an example involving smoking and lung cancer I saw in a math textbook that touched on many topics.  To be able to state that smoking increases the risk of getting lung cancer (and not get sued by \Big Tobacco\"")  every other possible connection had to be eliminated.  It had to be shown that race  gender  work history  educational background  location  and genetic predisposition (and other things that I can't think of at the moment) did not increase the risk of getting lung cancer as much as smoking did.

My reasoning is because many of the questions required the students to know some information about statistical reasoning and variability.  Teaching Academic Chemistry to 11th &amp; 12th graders means that my students are currently taking Math 2 and their understanding of numeracy and other mathematical concepts are lower.  In order to be successful  my students will have to have an understanding of variability and how data is analyzed.

But that's because those are things that AP thinks are important and therefore they are things that we spend a lot of time discussing.  I know at the beginning the box-plot problem might trip up a few  but they get pretty good with box-plots after a while.  They also struggle with standard deviation at the beginning but we use it so much they get good at it.  I've had kids stand at the front of the room in a line evenly spaced  then have one kid move farther away and we discuss how that changed the average distance  then I have everyone move a step closer to the door and we see how even though everyone moved  they are still the same distance apart (I find that using physical representations of things makes many topics easier for them to understand).  Of course  my students are juniors and seniors in high school who are typically high achievers with relatively high math abilities to begin with.  Teaching these concepts at a lower level would present its own set of challenges.

I agree with your comments about the video. It certainly was captivating  and the experts articulated some interesting perspectives. I would be one of the teachers that you mentioned in your post  who would ask students to arbitrarily collect data about 'shoe sizes' or 'height'. The one thing that stood out for me from the video  and from your post  is the need to engage learners (of all ages because I teach primary/elementary school teachers) in interacting with real data... data that are contextually relevant... data that are related to important social issues  even  that can stimulate discussion in other areas outside of mathematics.

Getting them in the habit of seeing that statistics is most useful to help us make sense of things that matter to us!   If you are interested in some follow-up reading  I recently wrote a brief article with a doctoral student who implemented a task in middle school (6th graders) that really was designed to help students understand the importance of context and how we measure attributes.

These projects allow students to gather their own data on topics that they are interested in (often they do things associated with grades  colleges or cars since I've got 11th and 12th graders  though I've had students do things with sports they enjoy  houses  and even Christmas presents).  Each project focuses on different skills.  The first one they have to gather 2 data sets and then find things such as mean  median  IQR  standard deviation  make dotplots  histograms  boxplots  etc. and then compare the shape  center  spread  and outliers of the data sets.  The 2nd project they have to gather data and try to see which x (explanatory variable) is a better predictor of y (response variable).  This involves gathering data  making scatterplots  finding regression lines and talking about r and r^2.  Some examples are: Does the # of 2 point baskets or # of 3 point baskets better predict the final score of a basketball game?  Does the hours spent sleeping or hours spent studying better predict a student's GPA?  Our next project will involve looking at sampling bias and the students try to come up with ways to create bias in their sample  test it  and then compare the results.  We also test the distribution of colors of m&amp;m's and test which model of paper frog jumps further and which model of paper airplane flies further.  These all deal with hypothesis testing  but could be modified for younger kids just by looking at dotplots or histograms.

During a PLC  we talked about in 7th grade how we can connect things in our statistics lessons about equations  expressions  and proportional relationships  which are a huge part of our standards.

In some of our other AP science courses (AP Bio and AP Environmental Science) the teachers use some statistical tools and tests in their labs.  I've found that the biggest struggle from these students is when they are expected to run a Chi-Squared Test of Independence.  Unless these students have taken AP Stats already  not one of them understands what they are doing.  Unfortunately  their teacher doesn't understand either.  He simply gives them a formula to compute Chi-Squared and table of P-values and has them make a conclusion.  I have always found that this would be an incredible opportunity to do some cross curricular work.  The reality is  however  that there often isn't time for either one of us to spend a day of class having the AP Stats and AP Environmental students work together.  Logistically  we also run into scheduling issues  as there are multiple sections of each course  and their period offerings do not always align.

The results were noticeable  now the students care to understand exactly how to use statistics - especially when in relation to money.

Work ethic is the main issue we are having  the ones that work well understand what is going on and are super engaged.  I hope to find a way to increase the students confidence with math  it might take me all year  but at least they will have a better chance for success in their future.

As others stated  we as teachers have to be motivated in order for our students to be motivated.  I spend a lot of time trying to make my lessons fun and interactive because I know if the students are engaged they will take away more.  Some topics are easier than others.  Just like it's easier to incorporate real world situations with some topics and not others.  I have discovered that once I got the mindset of making them interesting more students was becoming successful on the lesson.

As I looked at each task  I found that two out of three provided the students with data instead of allowing them to gather their data.  Task 1  the care weights and mileage learning goal was mathematical instead of being statistical.  The students were provided the data and it had no real meaning to them.  This task did not require the students to graph nor analyze their data.  As written  the task does not promote statistical habits of mind because it does not lend toward the students engaging in the statistical investigation cycle.  In order to make this task worthwhile have the students research their dream car and create a classroom data.  Once the class data has been collected have the students to graph their data  determine the linear regression of the line  slope  and equation of the line.  Then based on their data compare where various cars would fall on the line.    Task 2  Pepsi versus coke's learning goal is leaning towards statistics  however  the sample size and the method in which the data was collected should be changed.  Maybe if the sample size could be increased to the students in the hallway where after given permission during the first 10 minutes of class have the students in neighboring classes sample the beverages and state which beverage was preferred in a computer program where the class can see instantaneous data (bar graph).  The students can analyze the data and discuss the confidence interval.  Task 3 Television Time:  In order to make this task more meaningful the students could have conducted a survey the day before asking every 5th student  for example  how many hours of television do they watch each night.  The teacher then would have the classes data that they could create the dot plot and analyze the data instead of being provided the information.

Because I have a mix of juniors and seniors in the class and seniors are done about a week before juniors  I had to come up with something to keep the juniors busy that last week.  What I do is a \junior project.\""  Basically they have to come up with their own question they want answered  figure out how to gather the data  gather the data  analyze it  and then present it to the class.  I usually suggest they do some type of expansion on things we've already done in class.  One we do in class is look at the distribution of colors in plain m&amp;m's.  So often the kids will then compare different types of m&amp;m's to see if they have the same distribution  or see if other types of candy have equally distributed colors/flavors.  Another we do in class is 2 versions of paper airplanes (they are the same except for the first fold).  So then kids get excited to look up other types of paper airplanes and see which is the best.  Any project that I assign  I want them to pick something that is interesting to them.  Right now I've got a student who is very into cars and knows a ton about them.  So his project he's working on now deals with several factors that can affect the price of a car (also relevant to many high school students because they are learning to drive and getting a car at this time).  One thing I have learned is that I always want students to check their ideas with me first because there are certain things that just won't be possible for them to do at certain points in the class because they haven't learned enough yet.  Or I want to make sure that they consider certain things when gathering their data  even if we haven't yet discussed all of the things that go into collecting good data or doing a good experiment (it's in Ch. 4 in AP stats but we do several data collection things before then).  It also helps because then when we get to Ch. 4 we can talk about the things they've done prior to that and how they might want to adjust their methods for the next time.  """

Although the television task does not allow students to practice statistical  habits of mind but it can be changed to something like the use of social media (as you have mentioned).  I think social media is more relevant and motivating to students. Students can  collect data related to the different types of social media (FB   Instagram  YouTube  Snapchat  Twitter etc.) they use and the time they spend on  each which I think will allow students to practice some of the things mentioned in the guide. Students can even look at the relationship between the use of social media and academic performance.

I wonder if there is a way to motivate the initial data collection so that students can base their decision of what data to collect according to what issue they are trying to address. For example  I wonder if the current twitter battles between POTUS and other celebrities might lead to questions about the use of social media that are of particular concern to students. Could it be that they are interested in issues of cyber bullying? Maybe they wonder about what causes a social media post to go viral. Perhaps they want to know what their peers think is appropriate behavior on social media. Students would then be able to experience the challenge of collecting data that answers the question they are interested in.

They are not led directly to a statistical measurement and are instead given space to inquire and discover by themselves as they investigate the data.     Television Time - this would be a much better task if students were allowed to collect and display this data by themselves.

It can also be great in K-5 to connect math ideas to literacy  social studies  and science (since they teach it all!).  A quick example.

In the book  one of the events is choosing bagged snacks (chips  pretzels  popcorn  etc) from a large basket.  After reading  I asked the students about this event and how the coach could have probably made everyone a little happier with the snacks he bought in the basket. The kids intuitively knew that it would be best if the coach asked the kids what they liked.  So to help us plan for an end of year class party  we want to find out what types of bagged snacks we like as a class. The kids generated 3 items that were popular and what they thought most kids liked. After discussion  we came up with a class list of top five snacks to choose from. We then did a survey and every person got to vote for their favorite snack on that list. We used five different colored notes  one for each snack.. They also put stickers on their note  Boys got one color and girls got another color.  They wrote the name of the snack on the note and then we made a pictograph with those. They discussed what they could tell the teacher and I challenged them to make a decision about 2 snacks to buy that would make the most people happy  including both girls and boys!  <img src=\""@@PLUGINFILE@@/IMG_0593%20%281%29.JPG\"" alt=\""\"" role=\""presentation\"">     """

I did update and add some of the more popular chicken sandwiches and hamburgers from restaurants in our area.  We discussed the RDA for each of the areas before the task and whether or not the sandwich was healthy.  After constructing histograms and box plots  students discussed possible outliers.  One group separated the chicken sandwiches and the hamburgers and was surprised to see that two of the chicken sandwiches had more carbs.  That led to a discussion of why.  We talked about the healthier ones and everyone agreed that the Kids's meals would not be healthy because they would need more than one.  They also talked about combos and the super-size option.  Most students participated in the discussion and several students work at restaurants so that perspective was added.  I think the investigation was worth the time.  I used the discussion as a formative assessment along with the data representations.

I'm not all that great with chemistry but I wonder if you could find some type of linear relationship between the amount of some chemicals mixed and how much heat is produced?  Or volume of water and amount of time it takes it to all evaporate?  They could gather a bunch of data  run a regression  and then use it to make predictions.  That's just the first ideas that popped into my head (probably because we just finished a chapter in stats about finding regression lines and using them to make predictions).  This could also lead to a discussion about extrapolation (I'm thinking a massive volume of water might not fit with your lab-sized data gathered because it would just take so much longer to reach the boiling point).

However in mathematics there is more the logical thinking side and the understanding of units an precision.  It serves more as a tool to HELP investigate statitistical questions.

They then went on to set up the null hypothesis and calculate the <i>p</i>-value. (The methods here were without doubt more advanced  but the earlier groups were much younger.) They correctly noted that there wasn't enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis. However  they should not simply conclude that the die was fair - that would be a Type II error.

The ways in which each  group collected and analyzed data and interpreted the results indicated their  levels of statistical sophistication.       High school students inferred  that the die was unfair and justified by saying ‚ÄúI think if the die is fair  within these 100 trials  there should be 16.67 for each phase of the die.‚Äù They  went as far as testing the null and alternative hypotheses indicating that  their data collection  data analysis and interpretation was at more advanced  level than the first two groups of students.      Maria and Tasha concluded  that the dice was biased based on the fact that their probabilities were  different and pointed that they ran more trials (1000 trials) than the first  group (Dannie and Lara). Based on their statement that ‚ÄúDannie and Lara‚Äôs group  ran only 36 trials that is not that convincing‚Äù it is clear that they knew more  attempts made a difference in the results which indicated that they were at a  more advanced level than the first group of students.      Dannie and Lara were at  the most basic level. They did know that six trials were not enough for all  phases of the dice to appear and maybe they should run 36 trials which show that  they had the basic understanding that more trials were better but did not have  a clear understanding of the reasoning. They quickly came to their conclusion  that the dice was fair.

Most students learn by doing  especially with a generation of students who have been brought up with touch screens and technology that is verging on  if not fully converging with  full virtual reality.  The ability to directly manipulate data sets and alter the parameters of simulations is key to obtaining an intuitive understanding.

My students tend to ask lots of why questions and have little motivation to do something if I just tell them to do it. However  if they think it is a challenge or a puzzle they must solve  they are all in. Also  these simulations allow the students to make decisions and immediately see the consequence of that decision. I love that they can make their own decisions because they are more engaged and are learning to think critically. They love that they can do it themselves. Win-win situation to me.

Used to support both teaching and learning  technology infuses classrooms with digital learning tools  such as computers and hand held devices; expands course offerings  experiences  and learning materials; supports learning 24 hours a day  7 days a week; builds 21<sup>st</sup>century skills; increases student engagement and motivation; and accelerates learning. Technology also has the power to transform teaching by ushering in a new model of connected teaching. This model links teachers to their students and to professional content  resources  and systems to help them improve their own instruction and personalize learning.  Online learning opportunities and the use of open educational resources and other technologies can increase educational productivity by accelerating the rate of learning; reducing costs associated with instructional materials or program delivery; and better utilizing teacher time.

I mainly use the TI-84 graphing calculators (they have a great ProbSim app) and GeoGebra.  Some of my students will occasionally use Excel (I typically don't because Excel and I rarely get along).  There are a ton of pre-made simulations and such online and we use some of those to illustrate various points as well.  I've used GapMinder for a few things.  Of course  sometimes simply using real dice or a deck of cards is the best simulation.    I used TinkerPlots in my grad classes and have been considering finding ways to incorporate it.  I'm pretty sure I have the Fathom software but I've not yet had time to play with it.  I need to make a list of all of the tech stuff used here so I can play with it this summer and incorporate more next year.  I really like anything that's free and accessible to the students at home.

I have also used the motion detectors withe the TI-84.   Geogabra is a really cool application too. We did a lot with Geograbra last year in one of the workshops I attended. It takes some getting used to  but once you get the hang of it  it is very useful.  This summer we were studying the refraction angles of light in water.

I like music that is fast enough tempo that it doesn't put students to sleep (maybe keeps them tapping a foot or something) but I also prefer to not have lyrics because then the students will start singing along.     Or do an online search for Adam Young Scores.  He wrote  played  and recorded the music entirely on his own I believe.  Each series of songs is based on some historical event and the music represents that (the Titanic one is pretty neat).  They are completely free and most last 35-55 minutes  so it works well for a typical class period.

They start by playing the Two-Dice Elimination game  and then simulate rolling two dice many times using TinkerPlots to determine whether a step model or a triangle model of the distribution of sums is correct. Finally  they use the triangle model to calculate the probability of rolling each sum. Students really liked this activity and really grasped the concept.

Sometimes if my co-teachers are not using the whole cart  I might grab 5 computers to have station to squeeze in more technology usages in my classroom. The only downfall of using technology is that it is a computer and they do have a mind of their own. Sometimes  the internet services might be moving slow or the computers need to updated which tend to make technology day more like a headache than an enjoying experience for the students and teacher. However  I do feel that technology is needed in order to run a full functioning classroom.

As my university has been moving away from expensive textbooks and software platforms  and into the realm of open source software  I have been utilizing GeoGebra in other math courses due to its smooth compatibility with Google Drive  and ability to embedded into Drive-compatible interfaces such as RealTimeBoard  which allow for real time collaborative work to be done with large groups of students.  I have never used it for statistics before  and it seems like it is more intuitive than Excel  which has been my go-to since I've been teaching stats.

Constructions can be made with points  vectors  segments  lines  polygons  conic sections  inequalities  implicit polynomials and functions. All of them can be changed dynamically afterwards. Elements can be entered and modified directly via mouse and touch  or through the Input Bar. GeoGebra has the ability to use variables for numbers  vectors and points  find derivatives and integrals of functions and has a full complement of commands like Root or Extremum. Teachers and students can use GeoGebra to make conjectures and to understand how to prove geometric theorems.

Once the students had refined a question to investigate   I think it would be challenging for the students to deal with a large messy  data set.  It would be very interesting  to listen to group discussions on how to clean up the data.        I think students would benefit  from dealing with messy data sets that were smaller to gain insight on how to  clean up data in general before working with the Census at School data.  I think scaffolding of leaning prior to using  the Census at School data would be very important.

Cleaning up data is an important skill to master.  By the way  rather than just obtaining raw data from the random sampler  I would suggest using iNZight Lite  the analysis tool provided on the CensusAtSchool NZ site.

I love the idea of kids exploring messy data. I think far too often as teachers we have a tendency to give students problems that are come out nice and pretty but I think that through the struggle is when they really learn on a deeper level.

They used their reasoning skills to decide that riding to school by boat was not a typical route of transportation.  As they discussed the results in a little more detail they also decided to remove other methods of transportation.

They posed questions based on  their observations and real-life experiences making it more interesting  and fun to work with. They  considered all modes of transportation and then focused on the common ones eliminating  the ones that were less likely.  They also  took time into consideration and eliminated the extremities such as over an  hour. They first came up with simple questions such as mode of transportation  and the time it takes and then the relation between time and mode of  transportation. They were able to refine their question as they started looking  at the data and eliminating the outliers and irrelevant data.      They were also concerned with generalization of the  results which speaks about their basic understanding of how the results could  or could not be representative of all the states.      If I were to use something  similar to this in my class  for lower level classes I would start with much  cleaner data set just so that students are not so overwhelmed. I would use  something similar to the one provided in the videos for higher level students  so that they can learn how to deal with ambiguity and help them along the way  as they try to work with it to help them come up with meaningful questions   suggest data collection methods and help them with interpretation of the results.

In order to engage students to build a statistical mindset  the information must be important to the students. I feel starting with the students'  current school will allow students' minds to build curiosity about the reasons why some things are showing up a certain way in the data. Using information that is about their school  allows students to better see the variables that go along with the data. I believe it also allows students to better understand how all different kinds of variables must be considered when looking at the school's data. I will also agree that a teacher may need to clean up the data that is presented to the students at least the first three times before allowing students to discuss. However  I also believe that the teacher should allow the students to go through the clean up process with the teacher to show how to clean up the data and the reason why. The ultimate goal is to build a student's mind into a statistical mind frame.

That's what real statisticians have to deal with.  It also teaches students to find ways to deal with something that seems huge and unmanageable.     I'm currently analyzing data for our math department and the amount of data I have to start with certainly seems overwhelming.  But I've slowly been working through various ways to filter the data so it's useful and determine which outliers are ok to ignore and which are actually useful pieces of data.  I find it nice to be able to let students know some of these things and experience them as well.  It creates better thinkers and problems solvers.  The trick is finding the balance between enough data that they really have to work at it and too much data that makes them give up.

I had this experience when requiring students to download S&amp;P500 daily returns for a single year period from Yahoo Finance.  The data was easily retrievable  available in CSV format  and quite straightforward to analyze  but many of the students had the experience of opening up the Excel file  just staring at it with the look of a deer caught in the headlights.  I've had better experience slowly working students into large data sets  rather than dumping one on them all at once.

The third measure is an efficient way of differentiating between values and simplifying the identification of  for example  large countries  large customers  large quantities  and so on.   In science the scatter plot helps you find potential relationships between values  and to find outliers in data sets. The scatter plot is useful when you want to show data where each instance has at least two metrics  for example  average life expectancy and average gross domestic product per capita in different countries.

I think the data can be overwhelming for a student  but your idea on the cleaning up the data is exactly where I was heading with it too. It would give the kids a deeper understanding of the data in my opinion  because they would need to distinguish the difference between what data matters and what doesn't. This would require them to have a good working knowledge of how to use TinkerPlots to their advantage as well. I think the 40 questions allows for so many statistical questions to be posed as well  which I think leads in to an excelled idea of allowing the kids to think of their own statistical questions. Then we could take it a step further by having the kids trade statistical questions and answer another groups. They could then engage in an open class discussion about which statistical questions were harder to answer  etc.

I think the following two questions mentioned in  the handout will really help some of my students who have difficulty when it  comes to what makes a measurement valid and reliable. Posing the questions  first and then providing them the examples might help them better.      To what extent does this measurement really capture the  characteristic I want to measure?      Will repeat measurements on the same units give very similar  results?      I plan on using the questions with the examples below which I think  will be more helpful to my students.      Validity refers to the extent to which an instrument (test   questionnaire  etc.) measures what it is supposed to measure. For example  a  thermometer cannot measure blood pressure but only body temperature.       Reliability refers to the consistency of a measure. A measure is  considered reliable if the same result is obtained repeatedly when the measure  is repeated. For example  Rosenberg‚Äôs Self-Esteem Scale should provide the same  results if given twice to the same person within a short period of time.

We live in an information age. Computers allow us to collect and store information in quantities that previously would not even have been dreamed of. What is this information? It might be costs  values  sales volumes  measurements  ratings  distances  prices  percentages  counts  times  or market shares. But raw  undigested data stored on computer disks is of no use until we can start to make sense of it. Statistics is the human side of the computer revolution  an information science  the science (and art!) of extracting meaning from seemingly incomprehensible data. In your future life and career  you will need to be able to make good use of such information to make sound decisions.

Based on  the definitions given  I find the categories very ambiguous and agree with the statement:  ‚ÄúThese three categories of inference questions are not necessarily mutually  exclusive  and may not capture all types of questions that lead to inferential  reasoning.‚Äù      Task 1 explicitly  compares groups and examines competing models. Based on the prompt  it also implicitly  makes inference to the population  from the sample.  The same argument can be made for Tasks 3  4   &amp; 5 also.      Task 2  appears explicitly to be an inference of the population  based on a sample.  Based on the scaffolding of the problem  an  argument can be made that is also compares groups and competing models.      I whole  hardily agree that teaching inference is the most important aspect of an  introductory stats course  but I question the necessity of attempting to create  a taxonomy for different types of inference.

I am using these general categories to help organize the materials in the course and each type will be explained and explored more in the next 3 units.

High school students  in general  don't tend to care much about teacher salaries or geysers.  Playing games is fun  but generating the dice data feels a bit more abstract than student heights. The Geogebra applet is really well-designed  though  so I could be convinced otherwise!  Sleep deprivation is a very motivating topic  but I would want to hold off until later in the unit before using this data set.

But apart from the general interest the topic might cause  the histogram might lead to very interesting questions about the cofounding factors and more importantly about the influence of sample sizes on graphical representations.

I thought to myself  can I come up with a reason why these two groups might be different?  And that led me to look into it further.  Clearly  it is comparing two groups.  I also thought it might be interesting to students because it is data of high school students.  However  there is no question asked here.  I think it would be very easy to just add a question to ask  \Do vegetarians and non-vegetarians differ in height?\""  Just by asking this question  we are making this into an inferential task when it did not start out that way.  Then  we would want to learn more about the data - follow up questions start presenting themselves:  Are certain groups of people more likely to be a vegetarian?  Would there be another reason that group might be taller/shorter? We could add opportunities for repeated sampling by looking at different high schools or take other samples of the same high school.  In addition  we may want to address the relatively small sample size of the vegetarians and wonder if that group is large enough.    I really like recycling tasks from the beginning of the year - -even if we aren't using formal methods of inference  we can still foreshadow and get students thinking about making data useful. """

I'm not terribly familiar with this way of categorising tasks (but I'm sure I'll know more in 4 weeks time!) The context may be of interest to teenagers which has been pointed out in this unit as being an important feature of an investigation. It certainly lends itself to lots of discussion around causation  validity of the sample given the small sample size of vegetarians and sampling errors depending on what information was given about how the sample of taken.

We are asked in question (a) to compare the two distributions according to the relative-frequency histograms  and deal with the actual counts in question (b) (where students will likely compare the numbers 15 and 396).

Very little educational research can prove causation.  I wonder  what's the point of descriptive statistics  then?  Is it useful to draw conclusions about populations  even if we can't establish causation?  I see this happen all the time in state and federal education policy.  But then it feels like statistics is used to promote a particular perspective rather than seeking deeper truth.  I wish we could sign up politicians for this MOOC!

In addition  if you have descriptive statistics over time you get an idea which topics might be an issue in your school.  Of course  if you try to make generalizations which are not really supported by the data  you go into an altogether different territory.  That is way personally  I'm very interested in sample sizes when I hear about new results in how to teach best. Let us say a researcher did an experiment and found out that methode A is better then method B by an average of 10%. Apart from questions about the differences of methods in terms of resources  sample size is key. If the research was done with only 50 subjects the results have to be interpreted quite differently than with a sample size of 1000 or 10'000 students.  But the most important question here would probably be: Has the result been replicated by other researchers who don't have any connection to the original author?

In general this activity is strong.  To begin  the situation is presented as a  problem that you really might face.  This  aspect gives the activity purpose and is not just another textbook  example.  Giving purpose can help get  students interested and invested in the inferences they will eventually  make.  It also does a good job of asking  students to make inferences when is asks multiple times what is noticed or what  do you wonder.  In the end the activity  then guides students to use the data to now answer the questions that they have  come up with.  The activity is well scaffold  to push students to make the inferences and also to train them to get in the  habit of asking their own questions (what do they wonder).  Since there is more explicit direction given  in this activity I think it would be best for students that have not had much  practice with statistical reasoning.  It  could easily be adjusted for more experienced students by removing the specific  prompts that ask them to infer or pose questions to themselves.

I had assumed the task was about competing models. I see what you mean about using the time data as a sample  but it's not looking at random hours in a month to make conclusions about the whole month; it's a whole census of the times over 16 days.  What I really like about this task is the open-endedness of the graphical representations. Maybe all the students immediately turn to histograms of dot plots  but I imagine they might have other methods  too.

It is well laid out so it could be used early on. I actually went to Yellowstone last summer  and it was one of the first questions we asked: \How long will we have to wait\"".

One would be to create several side by side boxplots and get the students to describe/compare different days.  Another would be to call the entire dataset a population and each day a sample and create a sampling distribution.  We could also use bootstrapping to estimate the average time between eruptions and vary sample sizes.  Finally we could use randomization distributions and see if the average time between eruptions is the same between two different days.

This activity is open ended enough that you could achieve several statistical teaching goals.  I also really like activities that can be used as the year goes on!  For example  students may see this data in the beginning of the year when learning to make/discuss quantitative graphs.  And then again during random sampling.  And yet again when discussing inference.  Awesome activity!

SO the 16 days are a sample (not random) of days when times were recorded. Then students choose different random samples from this.  So different groups of students will have different samples  which may lead to slightly different estimates.  Hope this helps.  What opportunities for inferential reasoning do you see in this task? (or not)?

In addition  if this is the box plot for each region  what the box plot for the United States is. This question would be an inferential question about the country.      Another inferential question may be: Which region is more representative of the country?      Also  I can say that minor question students would be investigating in this task is Samples to the population in the sense of considering each region is a population and asking if the sample is representative of its population and then what is the teacher salary in each region as population. Moreover  what is the effect of sample size in each region in the inferential process?

I thought the questions that  were posed and the information provided did not give students a very good  opportunity for students to develop inferential reasoning habits.  It would be difficult for students to comment  on the ‚Äúgoodness of data‚Äù.  Hopefully   students would make inferences about the variability within a region and  between regions.      Task 2: The Old Faithful I categorized as samples to  populations.  I thought the background  information given would allow student to discuss the ‚Äúgoodness of data‚Äù and variability.  This task provides a pretty adequate  opportunity for students to develop inferential reasoning habits.        Task 3: Schoolopoly I categorized as competing  models.  I learned about this activity in  the Teaching Statistics Through Data Investigations MOOC and I thought a  version of it would be great to use in my own classroom.  It provides a pretty good opportunity for  inference.       Task 4: Vegetarians vs Non-Vegetarians I categorized  as comparing groups.  This task seemed similar  to task 1 where is not a great deal of background information given to discuss  the ‚Äúgoodness of data‚Äù  uncertainty  and variability.  Hopefully there would be some discussion of  inference  but the task doesn‚Äôt seem to give students that opportunity.        Task 5: Sleep deprivation I categorized as samples to  populations.  I thought this was a great  task which was similar to task 2.   Students would be able to have meaningful discussions about the 4 stages  of a statistical investigation and a main focus could be on the design of the  experiment and data collection.

This is a competing model problem. Students must set the number of rolls in the simulation app.  The Law of Large numbers comes into play.  Students will need probability teaching prior to attempting this task.  Probability is often an area where students have difficulty. Many reasons for this  one of which may be the lack of teaching probability in other high school mathematics courses. Due to current standardized testing and high school graduation requirements I don't see this changing soon.  This should change due to the importance of analyzing big data and the importance of statistics in real life.

With weighted dice  you could use this problem as a hands-on classroom activity to teach experimental probability and comparing results to theoretical probability.  It may take a while to get results but the students would enjoy it.  I like the fact that you can make it basic and not go through with an entire hypothesis test if your class is something other than statistics.     As for lack of teaching probability in other high school math classes  I fear it is more based on the fact that many high school math teachers do not want to touch probability or statistics.   If they have to include it in their curriculum  they may not understand it enough to go further than just plugging into formulas or calculators.  It is a shame because it is fun and so important for people to understand with all the data and statistics in the real world.

This is an area I have found that undergraduate students (in non-statistics subjects) have problems with especially when they come on to problems related to p-values and confidence intervals. Getting students to be familiar with issues of probability is essential for them to develop a more sophisticated understanding as they move on in their studies.

And obviously the discussion is needed once in a while.  The reason why it has gained more interest in the last few years may mainly be a result of statistical data being treated in a more automated way. When you look back at the beginning of statistical inquiries by the founders of the concepts mathematical calculations of statistics were so time-consuming that nobody did a lot of correlations just for fun. But now  everybody can just calculate hundreds of correlations and then proudly present statistically significant data. And when you look at how many publications don't stand the test of time in some areas  then we should be worried about the effects of people not adjusting properly for what they are doing.  However  as a first hint at whether a result is worth our attention  statistical significance is still a very important concept. It is just not enough. Calculating numbers is fine but using your brain in addition is even better.

The reason I didn't notice the redundancy is because as a middle school math teacher  I find that it is important to restate important concepts in multiple ways. My 12 and 13-year-old students would very likely miss the subtlety that estimates are always uncertain.  Kids this age typically consider estimates a single  static thing  not a probabilistic statement.

First  it is something that students can relate to and can get excited about.  Second  there are so many different measurements for each roller coaster you could simply ask students  what do you wonder?

Since it is something that they might have experienced in their own life  posing these questions might come more natural than in a data set that does not relate to them at all.  I think I would allow them to come up with their own questions first and then after investigating those if there were questions that I wanted students to pursue that did not come up I could then suggest them.

However  we should be honest about it. Both are not easy tasks. And to transfer what you see for example from a graph into words isn't easy either. So we should give students an opportunity to improve on their answers by asking questions like:  <ul><li>Can these finding be expressed in a different way?</li><li>Do we need some clarification for some steps?</li><li>Can we shorten the explanation?</li><li>Is it better to use a scientific expression or a popular comparison (depending on the audience)?</li></ul> We might also provide struggling students with stems or even model phrases to help them to formulate their conclusions.

All of the materials  examples  and roller coaster investigations completed thus far are comparing the distribution of a quantitative variable across different groups. I would encourage all of us as statistics educators to make sure we are including instruction about analyzing categorical data as well  as in reality that is often more prevalent than quantitative data. For this topic  it could include two-way tables  segmented bar graphs  side-by-side bar graphs  or eikosograms.

With the Roller coaster data  there are enough categorical variables that investigating association between categorical attributes would be very interesting.

At the same time to \control\"" their calculations might be difficult. That is were visualisation comes into play. In many situations it shows us whether a certain claim might hold some value or not. Visualisations are also more or less independent on the size of the actual data.  So changing the focus from the calculation of small simple datasets to the interpretations of bigger more complex data and then visualize that data is not only engaging it also provides a deeper understanding of basic statistics.  Other important factors contribute to this:  People who pursue calculations which cost them a lot of time might be less willing to admit that their findings are irrelevant than somebody who had the first impression from an automatically generated graph.  In addition a focus away from calculation to other aspects of statistics allows for better questions and gives as more opportunity to think about our findings and their implications.  Galtons famously said: When you can count  count.  With modern technology we can say: When you can visualize  visualize. """

It would not occur to me to make box plots based on means coming from different-sized states. This seems to be conveying something inaccurate. Wyoming would show up at a single dot the same way Washington state would  but one represents many more teachers. It seems like it might be better to work with the raw data here  so that the number of teachers who have these salaries are given their full weight. Am I off track there?? I'm a mathematician by training  so I have all kinds of statistical ignorance; I apologize if my concern is off base.

Therefore  each state's average becomes a single value that we're comparing. It doesn't matter that some states are bigger or smaller since it's the average that we're comparing.    If we wanted to get the national average  then yes  we would have to take into account the number of teachers for each state. In that case  we would look at the frequency distribution (each state average and # of teachers) to calculate the overall  or national average.

I think they would definitely be interested in data on teacher salaries  but I still have to figure out what I would want them to do with it.

I expected \wealthier\"" school districts to have higher teacher salaries  and they definitely did.

I follow the advice of doing a randomization test  and here is my result concerning track lengths. Among 1000 samples  &gt; 10% have the difference in means larger than that of the original sample. If 0.05 is the threshold  then I would say we do not have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis.  (For those who cannot see the numbers clearly  the difference in means of the original sample is 316.02 and the right tail proportion is 0.108.)

I used the Tuva Labs data and I am not sure I had similar results.  In fact  I was surprised at what I saw.    <img src=\@@PLUGINFILE@@/Screen%20Shot%202017-10-13%20at%207.59.03%20PM.png\"" alt=\""comparing speeds of different materials\"" width=\""1086\"" height=\""936\"" class=\""img-responsive atto_image_button_text-bottom\"">   See what I mean?  While there certainly faster steel roller coasters (see the outliers and long upper whisker)  75% of wooden roller coasters are faster than Q3 of the steel roller coasters.  I was surprised to see this - I assumed steel coasters would be faster.  I think this would be very appealing to students because of the unexpected results.  There were other unexpected comparisons as well  like age of the coasters.  I think I might give students this tool and ask them to play around and talk about any unexpected results.  """

I know that data set includes coasters from international locations.  I also noticed that the speed is supposed to be reported in Kilometers/hr. I am seriously wondering if when the data was pulled from the rcdb.com website by staff at TUVA if some of the coasters reported speed in mph and others in kph and it was not all converted to be on the same measurement scale.  I am going to look into this!!

I did the same box plot in Codap  and found that the median top speed for steel coasters was 60 mph. Since there are a lot of steel coasters clustered around 60 in your box plot  it seems like some of the steel coaster data did not get converted from mph to kph.

My first guess was that the slower steel coasters were mainly older coasters  but highlighting the \older\"" (pre-1980) coasters showed that that wasn't really the case (they are highlighted in blue).

I focused on if there is a  difference in track length between roller coasters that are inverted or not. I  expected that if a roller coaster was inverted it would be thrilling enough  therefore the ride itself would not have to be long hence the track length  would be shorter.       First  I cleaned up the data set by  removing all of the missing data which resulted in a sample size of 153  coasters.  I then used Minitab to obtain  the descriptive statistics.     <img src=\data:image/png;base64

However  one of my biggest complaints with them is that you wait in line  for a long time and often the ride is very short.  Therefore I wondered if one type of coaster  tends to have longer rides than the other.  I examined the duration for the types of coasters and eliminated the data that did not contain a duration.  Based on the data given it was found that the difference in means was -11.4 (Wooden - Steel).  So if you went just off of our data you could argue that steel coasters tend to have longer rides.  However  was this difference due to the type of coaster or could this difference have occurred by chance?  Using a randomized test of 1000 samples -11.4 and left represented .073 so we would not be able to reject the null hypothesis.         <img src=\@@PLUGINFILE@@/Roller%20Coaster.png\"" alt=\""Roller Coaster Duration Randomization \"" width=\""1593\"" height=\""863\"" role=\""presentation\"" class=\""img-responsive atto_image_button_text-bottom\"">  """

Nice use of StatKey. :-)  What I like about examining duration by the wood and steel groups is that students can first really explore the dot plots or box plots and talk about the amount of overlap. Seeing how these distributions overlap  along with the small difference in the means really tells a \no difference\"" story. After comparing groups in many different settings  seeing the plot like I have below  many students may be able to intuit that we dont even need to test much further if there is a difference....

For this data  the difference in sample sizes for the two types of construction material lends itself nicely to discussion around the effect of sample sizes  whether clusters really are clusters and so on. I will definitely be using Tuva with my classes as it's so easy to use and the graphics are appealing.

I used good old fashion regression so I could also determine how much of a difference the outliers made on the data.  For the height example  with all of the data in the model  there was a difference of means of about 51 feet; with the two farthest outliers removed  the difference was still 45 feet; and with the four outliers removed  the model still indicated a statistically significant difference in the means of 42 feet.  Based on the regression analysis with the four outliers removed  we would expect a wood coaster of 93 feet and a steel coaster of 135 feet.

I teach a developmental intro to stats course and this problem could easily be adapted to their needs.  I like having a data set that they can manipulate.     I imported the data for coaster material  and height/drop into Statkey.  After  cleaning the data (removing blanks)  I generated 2000 bootstrap samples.  The program selected wooden coasters as group  1 and steel as group 2 due to the order it encountered the variables.  I could have rearranged the initial data to  generate positive confidence intervals.  The  original samples have outliers  but the sample size is large and the bootstrap  distribution is bell shaped and symmetrical  so the application of  bootstrapping techniques is appropriate.         <b>Height:  </b>We are 95% sure that the difference in mean maximum height  of steel roller coasters is between 34.9 ft and 67.5 ft higher than the mean maximum  height of wooden roller coasters.  Since  zero is not a plausible value  we have evidence at the 5% level that steel  coasters have a higher maximum height than wooden ones.      <b>Drop:   </b>We are 95% sure that the difference in mean drop of steel roller  coasters is between 27.4 ft and 59.5 ft higher than the mean drop of wooden  roller coasters.  Since zero is not a  plausible value  we have evidence at the 5% level that steel coasters have a  longer drops than wooden ones.      <b>Surprises and expectations</b>      I was surprised by the magnitude of the difference between  the two materials.  Given our love of  bigger and bigger thrills  I would expect most new coasters to be constructed  out of metal and for them to be higher with even larger drops. P.S.  This posting technology still baffles me.  If the Statkey bootstrap distributions don't show up.....I will try again on another question....

In both cases we would reject the null and say that we have strong evidence that there is a difference in average top speed between the two materials.

Thus  I began by comparing the maximum height with top-speed  of all roller coasters  and they linear relation was found (Figure 1). Then I thought if this would happen with roler coasters with distinct type of materials (steel/wood). And I also found a linear relation between these variable for different materials (Figure 2).

You concluded that ultimately  steel coasters have a higher max height than wood tracks.  An unsurprising result is that steel coasters also have a longer track length than wood tracks.  Pat  however  was interested in whether or not the duration of these rides were different.  In spite of the higher max heights and longer tracks  he was unable to conclude that one type of track had a longer duration.  I wonder how much of this result is confounded by the notion that longer tracks with higher max heights also require a longer climb to get up to the peak.  In my roller coaster riding experience  this seems to be the longest portion of the entire ride.

You could argue that the typical type of vehicle used on rural roads is different to those used in urban areas.

When I figured out that the cost was actually fuel cost  I changed my mind and looked at gas mileage based on hybrid or not. Although there weren't enough hybrids in the sample to truly test  it could lead to some interesting discussions with the means and variability. Also  the first graph with city mileage had adjusted the y-scale  so at first glance  the means looked closer than they actually were. This too could lead to some good discussions. This was my first time really experimenting with CODAP. It was very easy to use  and I like that you can choose what to put on the graph  along with the data.   Adding cost of vehicle could add another good dynamic.

I like asking students to think about expected results before they play with the numbers.  It was also nice to give them time to think and discuss.  I assume at the end they also took time to talk about their results and how similar or dissimilar they were to their expectations.  I have not used the google random generator.  That was a nice find.  I also talk with my students about if something is truly random can an answer repeat.  I know that in this case she simply wanted different answers.  I think it is really good to have students estimate trend lines instead of always going with the simple generated line.

I thought that the majority of vehicles would use regular fuel. My experience with owning cars (and being not rich) has been that I've only ever driven a car that used regular gas. I was surprised by what I saw in the two samples. The first sample (#86) had three more cars that used premium gas than used regular gas  with only one car using diesel. The second sample (#11) had the same number of cars using premium and regular gas  with one car using mid grade and one car using diesel.     Once I looked at the brand name of the cars  the graphs made more sense. It seems like there are a lot of BMWs  Mercedes  Porsches  and other luxury cars  which are probably going to use premium gasoline.     This made me think about the difference between this data set  and what a sample of 100 cars taken from a highway or parking lot would look like. My guess is that a real-life sample of 100 cars would be much different (it would also depend a lot on where you were taking the sample).   <img src=\@@PLUGINFILE@@/Fuel%20Type%201.jpeg\"" alt=\""\"" width=\""468\"" height=\""363\"" role=\""presentation\"" class=\""img-responsive atto_image_button_text-bottom\"">   <img src=\""@@PLUGINFILE@@/Fuel%20Type%202.jpeg\"" alt=\""\"" width=\""557\"" height=\""475\"" role=\""presentation\"" class=\""img-responsive atto_image_button_text-bottom\"">  """

I give students a short text and they have to count the frequency of individual letters. Here the first problem arrives: Most students don't count the letters correctly. So  we've have to deal with measurement errors.  As we have looked at a short single text  we next try to find out how representative our text is for a typical text in the target language. For that step students will analyze additional short texts.  In a third step  we compare the frequency of letters accross several different languages and compare the frequency distributions. Then I give students a frequency table or graph and they have to find out what language the text was written in.  In a last step we use encryption (just change letters) to try to reconstruct the original message.

However  I'm a bit concerned about the long-term implications. I wonder  whether the use of \graphical\"" tools doesn't have a negative impact on data analysis later on when coding is a critical condition.  The problem is a bit similar to the one in coding classes: Is is better to use a graphical interface (block paradigma) or should students write \""real\"" code from the beginning?  In computer classes I have found that once students get used to the graphical interface they find coding even more tedious because they are getting used to quick results and flawless calculation processes.  But considering topics like reproducable research  I think at least in the professional domain coding will stay vital. Especially as graphical interfaces lock you in as a user. They do what they are made for very well but once you try to change something  you simply can't do it.

These kinds of activities are obviously meant to help them understand the concept of the sampling distribution and how we can make inferences about a population from a sample. But these activities tend to be done with populations that we have full access to. For example  the car data in this unit is not so big. In real life: Why take a 100-car sample when we can just compute things directly for the real population? There are a multitude of other activities like this  and some that students are explicitly asked to take repeated samples in order to better understand the sampling distribution. While I appreciate how important that concept is  how do we make sure students don't leave a stats class thinking that repeated sampling is a statistical technique? I think I finally found the answer in the animated .gifs provided: https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~wild/WPRH/ I love these *so* much. Thank you!

The fundamental idea is that we only have one sample and have to resample and make our distributions from that.  I mention repeated sampling from a population for such a short time (less than one class) that they don't seem to get fixated on it.

Yes  I ran the simulations and ran the binomial probability so I could see that Paul had around .003 probability (empirically and theoretically) to guess all 8 games correctly.  However  I want to know how the researchers decided which flags to put on his food.  Did they assign it randomly? The two predictions they showed in the video were both on the right hand food container.  I'm likely to believe there is some sort of lurking/confounding variable rather than believe that an octopus has ESP.     Clearly  I think this is a great task for sparking curiosity.  Also  with something as simple as a coin toss  students can easily do this by hand and take into the simulations.  I like how we were constructing our own dot plots and then adding them into the software.  I also like the Rossman/Chance applet for modeling large number of flips.  I think helping students understand what probability they would be comfortable 'rejecting' the model helps them really understand what's happening conceptually.

Students were highly compelled for sparking curiosity by doing the experiment of sampling  asking several competing and thoughtful questions related to the simulation and p-value  spending their time as playing together a game of simulation in the class rather than studying a topic in Statistics  and they can represent their issues of understanding the hall process of prediction.      What are different ways students can design hands-on physical methods for carrying out a simulation of Paul's repeated predictions?      The best way is the use of coin due to Paul‚Äôs prediction is about which team will win out of the two teams. If there is 6 swimmers challenge each other  the best way is the use of die?!      What are the benefits and drawbacks of using hands-on and technological tools to conduct simulations?      The benefit of using hands-on is increasing and enhancing the understanding of simulations and from another side  the drawback is taking more time (time is money). Therefore  the benefit of using technological tool is saving the time (there is less understanding as a drawback) compared with the hands-on tool if we jumped directly to the technological tool. However  if we gradually move from the hands-on tool to the technological tool as we saw in the video of randomization test  there would be no drawbacks from using the technological tool and of course  there are many benefits such as saving the time and enjoying the awesome technology.      What is the role of the teacher in designing and conducting the simulation?      The role is to explain  facilitate  manage  and simplify the understanding of simulation process as a tool to decide whether the null hypothesis is true or not.      How can these types of tasks help students develop a strong conception of a p-value?      These types of tasks would help both students and teachers in developing a strong conception and fully understand what it means by p-value by empirically conducting many different experiments (tasks) using technology.      How could this competing models task provide opportunities for inferential reasoning?      As long as these models discuss the test of the parameter  which comes from the population  so this would increase and improve the understanding of the inferential reasoning process by inference in the context about such characteristic(s) of the population.

However  I'm not meaning to sound cynical here  but I don't think my students   would ever come up with the ideas for the hands-on simulation. I teach at a community college  and many of them are non-traditional students. They don't have experience with simulations  either hands-on or computer generated. Even the younger students who are supposedly seeing some of this in public schools don't seem to have any real knowledge base. When we do things in class  they seem to treat everything as isolated events and don't build on earlier concepts.     I'm interested in hearing from others as to whether or not your students would be able to come up with ideas on their own  or would you have to completely design it for them.

Most years a student will come up with an idea that can be developed into a hands-on simulation....with enough time and prompting.  Years when we actually flip a coin and collect class data  the class drags  they get bored and I fall behind.    Lately  after the simulation idea has formed  I jump to statkey and generate one sample  then another and then a few 10's and then 1000.  They are tech savvy enough to understand what is happening with the simulation and quickly pick up on how rare a result of 8 out of 8 is.  Getting this transferred to understanding a p-value can take a while though.  Being able to go through many examples quickly by using technology improves outcomes.  My students will also play along during this exercise on their laptops.  Everybody gets slightly different results and this helps reinforce the idea that  the simulations are random.  In general though  I agree that the students lack experience with simulations.

One of the most difficult concepts I find to put across to students is the concept that the world around us is made up of a combination of random and systematic variation  and in statistics we are trying to discern the patterns that lead us to conclude that an observed result is due to systematic variation  despite the inevitable level of random noise that will always be around us. And when we find a `statistically significant' result that is the tipping point where we conclude that there is enough systematic variation to draw a conclusion that there really is some sort of relationship in our dataset.

Why (not)? </li><li>Do girls tend to have longer names then boys? (How far do you have to go down the list of the most common names before you can answer that question with a resonable margin of error)? </li><li>How many years back can you use data to predict the current frequency of names? </li><li>Looking at the figures of a single hospital  how typical is the data compared to a hospital nearby?

We   then compile all the results (with some cleaning) and then we upload the   data to use in StatCrunch. Throughout the semester  we refer back to   that data for labs the students work on and in class examples. The   attached image shows the 17-questions we ask.  The survey itself   opens up the conversation of sampling  who can we study  who can we not   study  etc. However  it is really fun to open up the floor for students   to ask to see what they want to investigate. For example  in class  we   will look at favorite movie genre as a whole. Then we split that among   gender and ask what they expect to see versus what does happen. I then   ask students what they might to see.  Later in the semester once we   have formalized hypothesis testing and are talking about testing for   independence  I always like to include two questions:  1) Is the #   of text messages sent in a day independent of gender? (This students   usually give mixed results in what they think will happen.)  2) Is   the # of text messages sent in a day independent of age group? (Students   usually believe one thing and are surprised at the results.)     All   of these are great in class because the students who participated know   that they are part of the data. In fact  when they see the raw data (no   names are posted)  they may even be able to find the one line of data   that is their response  making it very personal and gives them some   investment into the discussion. </div></div></div>

In an effort to get all in with this  I am taking a break in my AP stats class (in between 'descriptive statistics' and 'inferential statistics' any way).  So we are doing lots of simulations.  I also like doing this because it gives me a better idea of when I can put a lot of these activities.  We did the gettysburg address the other day and today we are measuring desks.  I am excited about today's activity because we don't know the actual perimeter of the desk.  And  I had students from our lowest level classes measure also so we have some more data than we normally do.  I am using CODAP to graph.  Some of my other favorite investigations include a beads activity where the proportions are different and we are pulling samples of 10 beads to see if the proportions are different than .5 (hypothesis testing).  I like this because you can see how different your data really needs to be to reject the null hypothesis.  It's 2 difference colored beads and population of 100 beads.  Some actual probabilities to pull a colored bead are .10  .20  35  50  65  80 and 90.  But when you run trials  usually only the groups who have the .10 and the .90 ratios can reject the null of .5.     I am super excited because I am going to change books from the Derveaux Vellman and Bock (which is super easy reading and I love) to a Rossman and Chance book.  That will take a lot of work  but it'll be worth it!

Even more: By using technology teachers can give a number of different tasks to students they can follow up  without having to spend hours over hours on tedious calculations just to see whether students answers make sense or are correct.  Therefore we can use technology in at least three ways:  <ul><li>Help students understand important concepts in statistics without spending time only on calculations. (As stated in the course  those still need to be done but probably with carefully constructed data set and not just for busy work.)</li><li>Allow students to investigate their own questions by using multivariate (big) data  and them letting them think how applicable their findings are in general.</li><li>Letting teachers concentrate what is really important in their student work instead of just checking the correctness of calculations.</li></ul> Thus  when you teach statistics  a teacher has to make informed choices about the type and amount of data to use in class and how it matches interests and abilities of the learners.

A simple example was one I caught while watching the local news. A police report was released stating the police department was not racist when it came to arrests for marijuana possession. As a math person  I instantly saw that the numbers did not \add up\"". Just by going to the news channel's website and reading the article online  I got an exact copy of the police report. It turns out the numbers were correct  but the news station did a poor job on accurately reporting them.    Of course  I couldn't stop there  so I showed students how the police department was also in the wrong with a little help from Simpson's paradox.    It lead to a great discussion and since it was local with local data  the students were really interested. Ever since then  I try to watch the news and find sensitive issues with data to discuss in class.   """

Without getting into the politics  we recently showed how race and abortion are not independent.  We also looked at prenatal testing for Downs Syndrome and Spina Bifida to show that the probability of having a child with either of these conditions when you get a positive test is actually extremely low.  We went on to talk about using data and information (which is always neutral) to make moral decisions.  Needless to say - they were engaged with these topics!

I ask students basic questions and they respond with their phones  and it visualizes the data  then I have students chat about what the graph means.   Another strategy that I've implemented is having students do the coin toss in class when talking about probability and have students make inferences from their findings.  I've also had students find a graph on the Internet and share it via a discussion board post in my online classes  and have them develop inferences of each others' graphs.   From this unit  I really like the idea of using data with simulation to get students curious. Once we \hook them\"" then we can get them to focus on inferences after they visualize or analyze the data. I also appreciate the expert panel's ideas for improving this class.        """

Inferential reasoning should be done from day 1. (Thank you Doug Tyson for the Smelling Parkinson's Task!) I think that for many tasks where the focus is something else (like calculating mean and median for example)  you can add a prediction question at the beginning  and a \what does this tell you?\"" question at the end  so that students work on inferential reasoning throughout the course."""
