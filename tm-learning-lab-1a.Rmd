## 1. PREPARE

The Text Mining Learning Labs during the second week of the Summer Workshop are guided by a recent publication by @rosenberg2020 and will focus on analyzing tweets about the [Next Generation Science Standards](https://www.nextgenscience.org) (NGSS) and [Common Core State Standards](http://www.corestandards.org) (CCSS). We'll dive deeper into these tweets in Text Mining (TM) Module 1: Public Sentiment and the State Standards. For now, this supplemental learning lab is designed to help you understand how data used in the study and the learning labs was collected. More importantly though, this supplemental lab is will get you up and running with the Twitter API in case you are interested in using data from Twitter in your own research or evaluation work.

### 1a. Load Libraries

#### tidyverse 📦

![](img/tidyverse.png){width="20%"}

As noted in our Getting Started activity, R uses "packages" and add-ons that enhance its functionality. One package that we'll be using extensively is {tidyverse}. The {tidyverse} package is actually a [collection of R packages](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages) designed for reading, wrangling, and exploring data and which all share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures.

Click the green arrow in the right corner of the "code chunk" that follows to load the {tidyverse} library.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

Again, don't worry if you saw a number of messages: those probably mean that the tidyverse loaded just fine. Any conflicts you may have seen mean that functions in these packages you loaded have the same name as functions in other packages and R will default to function from the last loaded package unless you specify otherwise.

#### rtweet 📦

![](img/rtweet.jpeg){width="21%"}

The `rtweet` package provides users a range of functions designed to extract data from Twitter's REST and streaming APIs and has three main goals:

1.  Formulate and send requests to Twitter's REST and stream APIs.

2.  Retrieve and iterate over returned data.

3.  Wrangling data into tidy structures.

Let's load the {rtweet} package that we'll be using to accomplish all three of the goals listed above:

```{r}
library(rtweet)
```

### 1b. Authorize RStudio

In order to authorize R to use your Twitter App to retrieve data, you'll need to create a personal Twitter token by completing the following steps:

1.  Navigate to [developer.twitter.com/en/apps](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apps) and select your Twitter app
2.  Click the tab labeled `Keys and tokens` to retrieve your keys.
3.  Locate the `Consumer API keys` (aka "API Secret").

![](img/create-app-6.png){width="80%"}

3.  Scroll down to `Access token & access token secret` and click `Create`

![](img/create-app-7.png){width="80%"}

4.  Copy and paste the following code into the R Script file named `twitter-auth.R` located in files pane, replace the four fake keys with your own, and pass them along to `create_token()` function.

```{r api-keys, eval=FALSE}
## store api keys (these are fake example values; replace with your own keys)
app_name <- "Text Mining in Education"
api_key <- "afYS4vbIlPAj096E60c4W1fiK"
api_secret_key <- "bI91kqnqFoNCrZFbsjAWHD4gJ91LQAhdCJXCj3yscfuULtNkuu"
access_token <- "9551451262-wK2EmA942kxZYIwa5LMKZoQA4Xc2uyIiEwu2YXL"
access_token_secret <- "9vpiSGKg1fIPQtxc5d5ESiFlZQpfbknEN1f1m2xe5byw7"

## authenticate via web browser
token <- create_token(
  app = app_name,
  consumer_key = api_key,
  consumer_secret = api_secret_key,
  access_token = access_token,
  access_secret = access_token_secret)
```

**Note**: these keys are named secret for a reason. We store these up in a separate R script file rather than in a R Markdown file that you will eventually share.

#### Check Authorization

The `create_token()` function should automatically save your token as an environment variable. So next time you start an R session -- on the same machine -- rtweet should 🤞 automatically find your token.

10. To make sure it works, you can run the following code and check to make sure the app name and `api_key` match those on your dev account.

```{r get-token}
## check to see if the token is loaded
get_token()
```

That's it! You're ready ready to start wrangling some tweets!!!

## 2. WRANGLE

### 2a. Search Tweets

#### Constructing a Query

Since one of our goals for TM Module 1 is a simplistic replication of the study by [@rosenberg2020], let's begin by introducing the `search_tweets()` function to mine some tweets about the Next Generation Science Standards.

Use the code chunk below to run the following code to request from Twitter's API 5,000 tweets containing the NGSSchat hashtag and store as a new data frame called `ngss_tweets_q1`:

```{r}
ngss_tweets_q1 <- search_tweets(q = "#NGSSchat", 
                                n = 5000)
```

Note that the first argument the `search_tweets()` function expects, `q =`, is the search term included in quotation marks and that `n =` specifies the maximum number of tweets we want.

#### 👉 Your Turn ⤵

Use the code chunk below to view your new `ngss_tweets_q1` data frame using one of the methods previously introduced to help answer the following questions:

```{r}
# your code here

```

1.  How many tweets did our first query using the Twitter API actually return? How many variables?

    -   

2.  Why do you think our query pulled in far less than 5,000 tweets requested? [Hint](https://cbail.github.io/textasdata/apis/rmarkdown/Application_Programming_interfaces.html#rate-limiting).

    -   

3.  How many tweets are returned if you don't include the `n =` argument?

    -   

4.  Does our query also include retweets? How do you know?

    -   

5.  Does capitalization in your query matter? Use the code chunk below to find out.

```{r}
# your code here 

```

#### Using the OR Operator

In *Understanding public sentiment about educational reforms: The Next Generation Science Standards on Twitter*, @rosenberg2020 accessed tweets and user information from the hashtag-based \#NGSSchat online community, including all tweets that used the following phrases: "ngss", "next generation science standard/s", "next gen science standard/s". Note that "/" indicates an additional phrase featuring the respective plural form.

Let's modify our query using the `OR` operator to also include "ngss" so it will return tweets containing either \#NGSSchat or "ngss" and assign to `ngss_or_tweets`:

```{r}
ngss_tweets_q2 <- search_tweets(q = "#NGSSchat OR ngss", 
                                n = 5000)

ngss_tweets_q2
```

#### 👉 Your Turn ⤵

In the following code chunk, try including both search terms but excluding the `OR` operator to answer the questions below:

```{r}
# your code here

```

1.  Does excluding the `OR` operator return more tweets, the same number of tweets, or fewer tweets? Why?

    -   

2.  Does our query also include tweets containing the \#ngss hashtag?

    -   

3.  What other useful arguments does the `search_tweet()` function contain? Try adding one and see what happens.

    -   

**Hint**: Use the `?search_tweets` help function to learn more about the `q` argument and other arguments for composing search queries.

#### Using Multiple Queries

Unfortunately, the `OR` operator will only get us so far. In order to include the additional search terms, we will need to use the `c()` function to combine our search terms into a single list.

The `rtweets` package has an additional `search_tweets2()` function for using multiple queries in a search. To do this, either wrap single quotes around a search query using double quotes, e.g., `q = '"next gen science standard"'` or escape each internal double quote with a single backslash, e.g., `q = "\"next gen science standard\""`.

Copy and past the following code to store the results of our query in `ngss_tweets`:

```{r}
ngss_tweets_q3 <- search_tweets2(q = c("#NGSSchat OR ngss",
                                       '"next generation science standard"'),
                                 n = 5000)
```

Notice the unique syntax required for the query argument. For example, when "OR" is entered between search terms, `query = "#NGSSchat OR ngss"`, Twitter's REST API should return any tweet that contains either "\#NGSSchat" or "ngss." It is also possible to search for exact phrases using double quotes. To do this, either wrap single quotes around a search query using double quotes, e.g., `q = '"next generation science standard"'` as we did above, or escape each internal double quote with a single backslash, e.g., `q = "\"next generation science standard\""`.

#### Our First Dictionary

We still have a few queries to add in order to replicate the approach by Rosenberg et al, but dealing with that many queries inside a single function is a bit tedious.

Let's go ahead and create our very first "dictionary" --- we'll learn more about dictionary-based approaches to text mining in Learning Lab 3 --- for identifying tweets related to the NGSS standards, and then pass that dictionary to the `q =` query argument to pull related tweets:

To do so, we'll need to add some additional search terms to our list. Run the following code to store your dictionary and queried tweets in your environment:

```{r}
ngss_dictionary <- c("#NGSSchat OR ngss",
                     '"next generation science standard"',
                     '"next generation science standards"',
                     '"next gen science standard"',
                     '"next gen science standards"')

ngss_tweets_q4 <- search_tweets2(ngss_dictionary,
                              n=5000)
```

Now let's create a dictionary for the Common Core State Standards and pass that to our `search_tweets()` function to get the most recent tweets:

```{r}
ccss_dictionary <- c("#commoncore", '"common core"')

ccss_tweets <- ccss_dictionary %>% 
  search_tweets2(n=5000, include_rts = FALSE)
```

Notice that you can use the pipe operator with the `search_tweets()` function just like you would other functions from the tidyverse.

#### 👉 Your Turn ⤵

1.  In the code chunk below, write a new query based on a STEM area of interest.

2.  Assign your search to a new object called `my_tweets` or something appropriate.

3.  Output your new dataset using the `datatable()` function from the `DT` package and take a quick look.

```{r}
# your code here

```

To learn more about constructing search terms using the query argument, enter `?search_tweets` in your console and review the documentation for the `q=` argument.

### 2b. Other Useful Functions

For your own research, you may be interested in exploring posts by specific users rather than topics, key words, or hashtags. Yes, there is a function for that too!

For example, let's create another list containing the usernames of the LASER Institute leads using the `c()` function again and use the `get_timelines()` function to get the most recent tweets from each of those users:

```{r, eval=TRUE}
laser_peeps <- c("sbkellogg", "jrosenberg6432", "yanecnu", "robmoore3", "hollylynnester")

laser_tweets <- laser_peeps %>%
  get_timelines(include_rts=FALSE)
```

Notice that you can use the pipe operator with the `rtweet` functions just like you would other functions from the tidyverse.

And let's use the `sample_n()` function from the `dplyr` package to pick 10 random tweets and use `select()` to select and view just the `screenname` and `text` columns that contains the user and the content of their post:

```{r, eval=TRUE}
sample_n(laser_tweets, 10) %>%
  select(screen_name, text)
```

The `rtweet` package also has handy `ts_plot` function built into `rtweet` to take a very quick look at how far back our data set goes:

```{r, eval=TRUE}
ts_plot(ngss_tweets_q4, by = "days")
```

Notice that this effectively creates a {ggplot} time series plot for us. I've included the `by =` argument which by default is set to "days". It looks like tweets go back 9 days which is the rate limit set by Twitter.

#### 👉 Your Turn ⤵

Use the code chunk below and to change the time series plot above from "days" to "hours" and see what happens.

```{r}
# your code here

```

### 🧶 Knit & Check ✅
