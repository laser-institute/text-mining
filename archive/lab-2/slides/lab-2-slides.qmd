# Part 1: Research Overview

Applying Sentiment Analysis in STEM Education Research

## What is Sentiment Analysis?

By summing the values related to each word in a document, we will be able to find out the tone or sentiment of the whole document.

## Discuss

Take a look at the dataset located [here](https://github.com/laser-institute/text-mining/tree/main/dataset) and consider the following:

\- What format is this data set stored as?

\- What are some things you notice about this dataset?

\- What questions do you have about this dataset?

\- What similar dataset do you have?

\- What research questions do you want to address with your dataset?

# Part 2: R Code Along

Lexicons!

\[Text Mining_Sentiment Analysis\]

## Inner_join

inner_join() allows us to keep only the rows with words that match words in our sentiment lexicons, or dictionaries, along with the sentiment measure for that word from the sentiment lexicon.

## Affin, Bing, Loughran, NRC

There is a difference in the intended use of the lexicon. The following figure shows the different lexicons, the number of words in the lexicon, resolution, calculation method and classification method.
