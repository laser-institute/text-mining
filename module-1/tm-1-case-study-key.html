<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">0. INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>For each Text Mining module, we’ll conduct a basic learning analytics workflow modeled after the Data-Intensive Research Workflow from <em>Learning Analytics Goes to School</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="krumm2018">(<a href="#ref-krumm2018" role="doc-biblioref">Krumm, Means, and Bienkowski 2018</a>)</span><em>.</em></p>

</figure>
</div>
<p>Each case study will focus on a basic analysis using progressively advanced text mining techniques that you’ll be expected to reproduce and eventually apply to a dataset and analysis of your own choosing.</p>
<p>This week, we will focus on analysis of open-ended survey items from an evaluation of the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction (NCDPI) online professional development offered as part of the state’s <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/issues/education/k-12/race-to-the-top">Race to the Top</a> efforts. For more information about the Race to the Top evaluation work, visit <a href="https://fi.ncsu.edu/projects/evaluation-of-race-to-the-top/" class="uri">https://fi.ncsu.edu/projects/evaluation-of-race-to-the-top/</a>.</p>
<section id="case-study-focus" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="case-study-focus">Case Study Focus</h3>
<p>For Module 1, our focus will be on getting our text “tidy” so we can perform some basic word counts, look at words that occur at a higher rate in a group of documents, and examine words that are unique to those document groups. Specifically, the Module 1 Case Study will cover the following workflow topics:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Prepare</strong>: Prior to analysis, it’s critical to understand the context and data sources you’re working with so you can formulate useful and answerable questions.</li>
<li><strong>Wrangle</strong>: Wrangling data entails the work of manipulating, cleaning, transforming, and merging data. In section 2 we focus on reading, reducing, and tidying our data.</li>
<li><strong>Explore</strong>: In section 3, we use simple summary statistics, more sophisticated approaches like term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf), and basic data visualization to explore our data and see what insight it provides in response to our question.</li>
</ol>
<p>While we won’t investigate approaches to <strong>Model</strong> our data until Module 3 when we learn about topic models, we will be developing “data products” next week to <strong>Communicate</strong> key findings and insights.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="prepare">1. PREPARE</h2>
<p>Prior to analysis, it’s critical to understand the research context and data sources available so you can formulate useful questions that can be feasibly addressed by your data. For this section, we’ll focus on the following topics:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><strong>Context</strong>. We learn a little bit about the North Carolina Race to the Top grant and the evaluation of the online professional development work, including questions and findings from the 2012 report.</li>
<li><strong>Questions.</strong> What aspects of online professional development offerings do <strong>teachers</strong> find most valuable?</li>
<li><strong>Libraries.</strong> We revisit the [tidyverse] package and are introduced to the [tidytext] companion packages for text processing the “tidy” way.</li>

<p><a href="https://fi.ncsu.edu/resource-library/race-to-the-top-online-professional-development-evaluation-year-1-report/">2012 Annual Report</a></p>
<p>North Carolina was one of 12 recipients of the 2010 federal Race to the Top (RttT) grants, bringing nearly $400 million to the state’s public school system. Over the course of four years, NC’s RttT coordinated a set of activities and policy reforms designed to collectively improve the performances of students, teachers, leaders, and schools.</p>
<p>The North Carolina Race to the Top (RttT) proposal (North Carolina Office of the Governor, 2010) specifies that the state’s Professional Development Initiative will focus on the “use of e- learning tools to meet the professional development needs of teachers, schools, and districts” (p.&nbsp;191). It points to research demonstrating that “well-designed and well-implemented online professional development programs are not only valued by teachers but also positively impact classroom practices and student learning.”</p>
<p><strong>Data Source &amp; Analysis</strong></p>
<p>The evaluation used a wide range of data sources including interviews, document review, site analytics, and surveys, which we’ll focus on for this case study. Survey protocols were designed in cooperation with NCDPI to systematically collect information about local professional development, state-level supports, use of available RttT professional development resources, and organizational and classroom practices in the schools, which will serve as a baseline to assess changes over the period of the North Carolina RttT initiatives.</p>
<p>Quantitative analyses focused primarily on descriptive analysis of item-level responses. In addition, quantitative data from these surveys were analyzed to examine patterns in responses by participants’ role, event type (e.g., module, webinar, resource), and region. Responses to open-ended survey items of the Online Resources Survey were manually coded by their relation to each Learning Forward professional development standard.</p>

<p><strong>Summary of Findings</strong></p>
<p>Approximately half of the state’s educators completed at least one online module by the end of the 2011-12 school year. Overall, most participants agreed that the webinars and modules were relevant to their professional development needs, though some content was redundant with prior PD activities and not always content- or grade-specific, and some modules did not fully address national standards for professional development. Moreover, most online modules were completed independently and not in Professional Learning Community groups.</p>
<p>A common theme from focus groups and open-ended survey responses was the <strong>convenience</strong> of online professional development. One teacher in a focus group stated, “I liked the format. And the way that it was given, it was at your own pace, which works well for our schedules…” Educators also frequently cited that the <strong>information and resources</strong> provided through the modules improved their understanding of the new standards and the teacher evaluation process. Webinar participants appreciated the useful, updated information presented through a combination of PowerPoint slides and <strong>video clips</strong>.</p>
<p>While the majority of educators have indicated their satisfaction with these resources, the findings suggest that the use of these resources at both the state and local level was not wholly consistent with national standards for online professional development. Many LEAs likely needed additional guidance, training, support, technology tools, and/or content resources to ensure that local efforts contribute to the quality of the experiences for educators and that the vision for online professional development outlined in the state’s RttT proposal is realized and can be sustained beyond RttT.</p>

<section id="b.-guiding-questions" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="b.-guiding-questions">1b. Guiding Questions</h3>
<p>The State’s progress on designing and implementing online professional development was originally guided by the following (very) general evaluation questions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>State Strategies</strong>: To what extent did the state implement and support proposed RttT professional development efforts?</li>
<li><strong>Short-Term Outcomes</strong>: What were direct outcomes of state-level RttT professional development efforts?</li>
</ol>
<p>For this case study, we’ll use basic text analysis techniques to complement prior qualitative analyses conducted as part of the RttT Evaluation by examining responses to open-ended questions on the RttT Online PD Survey administered to over 15,000 NC educators.</p>
<p>Our (very) specific questions of interest for this case study are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>What aspects of online professional development offerings do <em>teachers</em> find most valuable?</li>
<li>How might resources differ in the value they afford teachers?</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, one overarching question we’ll explore throughout this course, and that Silge and Robinson (2018) identify as a central question to text mining and natural language processing, is:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>How do we <strong>quantify</strong> what a document or collection of documents is about?</p>

<p>Recall from earlier tutorials that the {tidyverse} package is actually a <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/packages">collection of R packages</a> designed for reading, wrangling, and exploring data and which all share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures. These shared features are sometimes “tidy data principles.”</p>

<p>As you’ve probably already noticed from viewing our dataset, we clearly have more data than we need to answer our rather basic research question.

<p><a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org"><strong><code>dplyr</code></strong></a> <strong>functions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><code>select()</code> picks variables based on their names.</li>
<li><code>slice()</code> lets you select, remove, and duplicate rows.</li>

</ul>
<section id="subset-columns" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="subset-columns">Subset Columns</h4>
<p>Recall that our research questions are focused on understanding aspects of online professional development offerings that <em>teachers</em> find most valuable and how these resources may differ in the value they offer teachers. To help address our research question, let’s first reduce our dataset to only the columns needed.</p>
<p>To begin, we’ll <code>select()</code> the columns <code>Role</code>, <code>Resource</code>, and <code>Q21</code> since those respectively pertain to educator role, OPD resource they are evaluating, and, as illustrated by the second row of column Q21, their response to the survey question, “What was the most beneficial/ aspect of the professional development resource?”</p>
<p>We’ll also assign these selected columns to a new data frame named <code>opd_selected</code> by using the <code>&lt;-</code> assignment operator.</p>
<p>Run the following code:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb9"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb9-1"><a href="#cb9-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>opd_selected <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu">select</span>(opd_survey, Role, Resource, Q21)</span></code><button title="Copy to Clipboard" class="code-copy-button"><i class="bi"></i></button></pre></div>

<section id="your-turn-4" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="your-turn-4"><strong>👉 Your Turn ⤵</strong></h4>
<p>Suppose we were interested instead in analyzing how educators are are using the online resources instead of the most beneficial aspects.</p>
<p>Change the code below to select the correct columns and then run the code:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb10"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb10-1"><a href="#cb10-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>opd_use <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu">select</span>(opd_survey, Role, Resource, Q20)</span></code><button title="Copy to Clipboard" class="code-copy-button"><i class="bi"></i></button></pre></div>
</div>
<p>Notice that, like the bulk of tidyverse functions we’ll be using throughout our case studies, the first argument that the <code>select()</code> function expects is a data frame, which in our case is <code>opd_survey</code>. The <code>select()</code> function the expects the specific columns you’d like to select.</p>
<p>Another common approach to providing tidyverse functions a data frame is to use the <code>|&gt;</code> pipe operator from the {maggitr] package, which is used to “pipe” inputs and outputs from one function to another. This operator is used so frequently in R, that it has now built into R with the new <code>|&gt;</code> pipe operator.</p>
<p>Run the following code to select the columns <code>Role</code>, <code>Resource</code>, and <code>Q21</code> columns and assign these columns to a new data frame named <code>opd_selected</code>:</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="rename-columns">Rename Columns</h4>
<p>Notice that Q21 is not a terribly informative variable name.

<p>This naming is somewhat intentional because not only is it the text we are interested in analyzing, but also mirrors the naming conventions in our Text Mining with R <span class="citation" data-cites="silge2017text">(<a href="#ref-silge2017text" role="doc-biblioref">Silge and Robinson 2017</a>)</span> course book and will make it easier to follow the examples there.</p>

<p>When we used two <code>==</code> signs to filter for rows when Role is equal to Teacher. This was different than when we used just on = sign to rename our column.</p>
<p>In R, the single <code>=</code> sign is used for creating new variables, object or value, while the double == sign is used to test if two values are equal.</p>
<p>The single <code>=</code> can also be used used for assigning the output of a function to a new objects, like so:</p>
<p><code>opd_complete = drop_na(opd_sliced)</code></p>
<p>However, using and == for comparisons and the <code>&lt;-</code> operator for assignment avoids ambiguity and makes the code easier to read and maintain.</p>

<p>Well done! Our text is now ready to be tidied!!!</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="c.-tidy-text" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="c.-tidy-text">2c. Tidy Text</h3>
<p>For this part of our workflow we focus on the following functions from the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidytext/"><code>tidytext</code></a> and <code>dplyr</code> packages respectively:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>unnest_tokens()</code> splits a column into tokens</li>
<li><code>anti_join()</code> returns all rows from x with<strong>out</strong> a match in y.</li>
</ul>
<section id="tidy-data-principles" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="tidy-data-principles">Tidy Data Principles</h4>
<p>Not surprisingly, the Tidyverse set of packages including packages like <code>dplyr</code> adhere “tidy” data principles <span class="citation" data-cites="wickham2023r">(<a href="#ref-wickham2023r" role="doc-biblioref">Wickham, Çetinkaya-Rundel, and Grolemund 2023</a>)</span>. Tidy data has a specific structure:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each variable is a column</li>
<li>Each observation is a row</li>
<li>Each type of observational unit is a table</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="question-1" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="question-1">❓Question</h4>
<p>According to <a href="https://r4ds.hadley.nz/data-tidy.html#sec-tidy-data">tidy data</a> principles, why do you think the data frame below would be considered “untidy”?</p>
<ul>
<li>YOUR RESPONSE HERE</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="img/untidy.png" class="img-fluid" style="width:100.0%"></p>
<p>Text data, by it’s very nature is ESPECIALLY untidy. In <a href="https://www.tidytextmining.com/tidytext.html">Chapter 1 of Text Mining with R</a>, Silge and Robinson define the tidy text format as:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>a table with <strong>one-token-per-row</strong>. A token is a meaningful unit of text, such as a word, that we are interested in using for analysis, and tokenization is the process of splitting text into tokens.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this section, our goal is to transform our <code>opd_teacher</code> text data from this:</p>
<p><img src="img/untidy-text.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>to this:</p>
<p><img src="img/tidy-text.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>This one-token-per-row structure differs from how text is often stored, perhaps as strings or in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document-term_matrix#:~:text=A%20document%2Dterm%20matrix%20is,and%20columns%20correspond%20to%20terms.">document-term matrix</a>. The <strong>token</strong> that is stored in each row is most often a single word, but can also be an n-gram (e.g., a sequence of 2 or 3 words), a sentence, or even a whole paragraph. Conveniently, the tidytext package, provides functionality for tokenizing text by common units like these into a one-term-per-row format.</p>
</section>
<section id="tokenize-text" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="tokenize-text">Tokenize Text</h4>
<p>In order to tidy our text, we need to break the text into individual tokens (a process called tokenization) and transform it to a tidy data structure. To do this, we use tidytext’s incredibly powerful <code>unnest_tokens()</code> function.</p>
<p>After all the work we did prepping our data, this is going to feel a little anticlimactic.</p>
<p>Run the following code to tidy our text and save it as a new data frame named <code>opd_tidy</code>:</p>

<p>There is A LOT to unpack with this function. First notice that <code>unnest_tokens</code> expects a data frame as the first argument, followed by two column names. The first is an output column name that doesn’t currently exist (<code>word</code>, in this case) but will be created as the text is unnested into the new column. This if followed by the input column that the text comes from which we uncreatively named <code>text</code>. Also notice:</p>
<ul>
<li>Other columns, such as <code>Role</code> and <code>Resource</code>, are retained.</li>
<li>All punctuation has been removed.</li>
<li>Tokens have been changed to lowercase, which makes them easier to compare or combine with other datasets. However, we can use the <code>to_lower = FALSE</code> argument to turn off this behavior if desired.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="remove-stop-words" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="remove-stop-words">Remove Stop Words</h4>
<p>One final step in tidying our text is to remove words that don’t add much value to our analysis (at least when using this approach) such as “and”, “the”, “of”, “to” etc. The <code>tidytext</code> package contains a <code>stop_words</code> dataset derived from three different lexicons that we’ll use to remove rows that match words in this dataset.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at the first 20 stop words so we know what we’re getting rid of from our <code>opd_tidy</code> dataset.</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb34"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb34-1"><a href="#cb34-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">head</span>(stop_words, <span class="dv">20</span>)</span></code><button title="Copy to Clipboard" class="code-copy-button"><i class="bi"></i></button></pre></div>

</div>
<p>Now run the following code to view all stop words in each lexicon:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb36"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb36-1"><a href="#cb36-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">view</span>(stop_words)</span></code><button title="Copy to Clipboard" class="code-copy-button"><i class="bi"></i></button></pre></div>
</div>
<p>In order to remove these stop words, we will use function called <code>anti_join()</code> that looks for matching values in a specific column from two datasets and returns rows from the original dataset that have no matches. For a good overview of the different <code>dplyr</code> joins see here: <a href="https://medium.com/the-codehub/beginners-guide-to-using-joins-in-r-682fc9b1f119" class="uri">https://medium.com/the-codehub/beginners-guide-to-using-joins-in-r-682fc9b1f119</a></p>
<p><img src="img/anti-join.png" class="img-fluid" style="width:80.0%"></p>
<p>Let’s remove rows from our <code>opd_tidy</code> data frame that contain matches in the <code>word</code> column with those in the <code>stop_words</code> dataset and save it as <code>opd_clean</code> since we were done cleaning our data at this point.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="explore">3. EXPLORE</h2>
<p>As highlighted in both DSEIUR and Learning Analytics Goes to School, calculating summary statistics, data visualization, and feature engineering (the process of creating new variables from a dataset) are a key part of exploratory data analysis <span class="citation" data-cites="estrellado2020data krumm2018">(<a href="#ref-estrellado2020data" role="doc-biblioref">Estrellado et al. 2020</a>; <a href="#ref-krumm2018" role="doc-biblioref">Krumm, Means, and Bienkowski 2018</a>)</span>. One goal in this phase is to explore questions that drove the original analysis and develop new questions and hypotheses to test in later stages. In Section 3, we will calculate some very basic summary statistics from our tidied text, explore key words of interest to gather additional context, and use data visualization to identify patterns and trends that may not be obvious from our tables and numerical summaries.</p>
<p>Topics addressed in Section 3 include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Summary Stats</strong>. We focus primarily on the use of word counts and calculating proportions to to help us identify common words used to describe the most valuable aspects of online professional development offerings.</li>
<li><strong>Word Search</strong>. We learn about the global regular expression parser, or <code>grep</code> package in R, to search for key words among our data set.</li>
<li><strong>Data Visualization</strong>. Finally, we wrap up this case study and by creating wordclouds, bar plots, and small multiple charts to explore patterns and trends that would be difficult to distinguish otherwise.</li>
</ul>
<section id="a.-summary-stats" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a.-summary-stats">3a. Summary Stats</h3>
<p>Prior to making any data visualization, we revisit the overarching question guiding most of our efforts in the text mining modules, “How do we <strong>quantify</strong> what a text is about?”</p>
<p>In this section, we introduce the following functions:</p>
<p><a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org"><strong><code>dplyr</code></strong></a> <strong>functions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/count.html?q=count"><code>count()</code></a> lets you quickly count the unique values of one or more variables</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/grouping.html?q=group"><code>group_by()</code></a> takes a data frame and one or more variables to group by</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/summarise.html"><code>summarise()</code></a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/mutate.html"><code>mutate()</code></a> adds new variables and preserves existing ones</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/mutate-joins.html?q=join"><code>left_join()</code></a> add columns from one dataset to another</p></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidytext/index.html"><strong><code>tidytext</code></strong></a> <strong>functions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://juliasilge.github.io/tidytext/reference/bind_tf_idf.html">bind_tf_idf()</a> binds the term frequency and inverse document frequency of a tidy text dataset to the dataset</li>
</ul>
<section id="term-frequency" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="term-frequency">Term Frequency</h4>
<p>As highlighted in <a href="https://tedunderwood.com/2013/02/20/wordcounts-are-amazing/">Word Counts are Amazing</a>, one simple but powerful approach to text analysis is counting the frequency in which words, or terms, occur in a given collection of documents, or corpus.</p>
<p>Now that we have our original survey data in a tidy text format, we can use the <code>count()</code> function from the <code>dplyr</code> package to find the words used most frequently by teachers when asked, “What was the most beneficial/valuable aspect of this online resource?”</p>

<p>Going back to findings from the original report, a strategy as simple basic word counts resulted in key words consistent with findings from the qualitative analysis of focus-group transcripts and open-ended survey responses.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Educators frequently cited that the <strong>information and resources</strong> provided through the modules improved their understanding of the new standards and the teacher evaluation process.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>See also this finding around video clips:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Webinar participants appreciated the useful, updated information presented through a combination of PowerPoint slides and <strong>video clips</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One notable distinction between word counts and traditional qualitative analysis is that broader themes like “convenience” often are not immediately apparent in words counts, but rather emerges from responses containing words like “pace”, “format”, “online”, “ease”, and “access”.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>A common theme from focus groups and open-ended survey responses was the <strong>convenience</strong> of online professional development. One teacher in a focus group stated, “I liked the format. And the way that it was given, it was at your own pace, which works well for our schedules…”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <code>count()</code> function can also be used with more than one column to count the frequency a word occurs for a select <code>Resource</code> in our dataset.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="relative-frequency">Relative Frequency</h4>
<p>One common approach to facilitate comparison of responses across Online Resource type is by looking at the <strong>relative frequency (percent)</strong> that each word, or term, occurs among all words for that document group. This also helps to better gauge how prominent the same word is across different groups.</p>
<p>For example, let’s create counts for each <code>Resource</code> and <code>word</code> paring, and then create a new column using the <code>mutate()</code> function that calculates the proportion that word makes up among all words.</p>
<p>To do this a little more efficiently, let’s use the |&gt; operator again:</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="term-frequency-inverse-document-frequency">Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency</h4>
<p>Term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf) is an approach that takes this one step further.</p>
<p>As noted in <a href="https://www.tidytextmining.com/tfidf.html">Tidy Text Mining with R</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The statistic <strong>tf-idf</strong> is intended to measure how important a word is to a document in a collection (or corpus) of documents, for example, to one novel in a collection of novels or to one website in a collection of websites.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Silge and Robinson note that tf-idf aims to identify the most significant words in a document by reducing the emphasis on frequently used words and amplifying the importance of words that are relatively rare across a collection or corpus. In other words, <strong>tf-idf highlights terms that are important within a group but not overly common across groups</strong>.</p>
<p>The <code>tidytext</code> package has a function called <code>bind_tf_idf()</code> that takes a tidy text dataset as input with one row per token (term), per document. One column (word here) contains the terms/tokens, one column contains the documents (book in this case), and the last necessary column contains the counts, how many times each document contains each term (n in this example).</p>
<p>Because tf-idf can account for “too common” words like “and” or “but” through weighting, when calculating tf-idf it is not necessary to remove stop words. However, we will need add a column for total words for each <code>Resource</code> type, which can be accomplished in a couple of steps.</p>
<p>First, let’s recycle our <code>opd_teacher</code> data frame from above, tokenize teacher responses while retaining stop words, and calculate counts for each word again. However, this time instead of word counts for the total data set, we’ll calculate word counts by <code>Resource</code>.</p>

<p>Notice that idf and thus tf-idf are zero for extremely common words (typically stop words). These are all words that appear in teacher responses across many or even all online resource types.</p>
<p><img src="img/idf-zero.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>The inverse document frequency (and thus tf-idf) is very low (near zero) for words that occur in many of the documents in a collection; this is how this approach decreases the weight for common words.</p>
<p>For words that occur in fewer of the documents in the collection, or in our case survey responses by resource type, the inverse document frequency will be a higher number.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at the top five most unique words for each resource type:</p>

<p>While some of these words make sense and are useful for for distinguishing the unique value of a resource, like “reflection” for Online Learning Modules or “interface” for Calendar, it’s obvious many of these words were only identified as unique simply because they were misspelled words. Clearly something we would attend to for a more rigorous analysis.</p>

<p>This section is a really quick aside and primarily meant to introduce the <code>grep</code> package that we’ll be using in future modules.</p>
<p>A quick word count actually resulted in findings fairly consistent with some of the qualitative findings reported, but also lacked some nuance, unsurprisingly, and left some questions about what some of the more frequent words were in reference to.</p>
<p>Let’s again use our <code>opd_teacher</code> survey data frame that contains the complete teacher responses and apply the handy <code>filter()</code>, <code>select()</code> and <code>grepl()</code> function to select just our <code>text</code> column and filter out responses that contain key words of interest. For example, what aspects of “online” made it beneficial.</p>
<p>We can view all quotes in the source pane, or use the <code>sample_n()</code>, yes from the <code>dplyr</code> package, to select any number of random quotes. In this case 20:</p>

<p>In some cases, we can see that the use of the word “online” was simply repetition of the question prompt, but in other cases we can see that it’s associated with the broader theme of “convenience” as with the quote, “This online resources gave me the opportunity to study on my own time.”</p>
<p>Note that you can also use regular express operators with <code>grep</code> like the <code>*</code> operator to search for word stems. For example using <code>inform*</code> in our search will return quotes with “inform”, “informative”, “information”, etc.</p>

<p>We covered data visualization pretty extensively in ECI 586: Introduction to Learning Analytics, but for those new to data visualization in R, the go to package for standard charts and graphs is <a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org"><code>ggplot2</code></a>. Hadley Wickham’s <a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html">R for Data Science</a> and [ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data] are also great introductions to data visualization in R with ggplot2.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/wordcloud2/vignettes/wordcloud.html"><code>wordcloud2</code></a> package is pretty dead simple for generating HTML based word clouds.</p>

<p>I use wordclouds pretty sparingly in articles or reports, but typically include them for open ended items in online survey reports to provide education partners a quick snapshot of item responses.</p>
<p>Once installed, I recommend using <code>?wordcloud2</code> to view the various arguments for cleaning up the default view. For example:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb86"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb86-1"><a href="#cb86-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">wordcloud2</span>(teacher_counts, <span class="at">color =</span> <span class="st">"random-light"</span>, <span class="at">backgroundColor =</span> <span class="st">"black"</span>)</span></code><button title="Copy to Clipboard" class="code-copy-button"><i class="bi"></i></button></pre></div>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="basic-bar-chart">Basic Bar Chart</h4>
<p>The bar chart is the workhorse for data viz and is pretty effective for comparing two or more values. Given the unique aspect of our tidy text data frame, however, we are looking at upwards of over 5,000 values (i.e.&nbsp;words and their counts) to compare.</p>
<p>So let’s first limit our data set to only words with over 500 or more occurrence using the hand <code>filter()</code> function and the greater than or equal to <code>&gt;=</code> operator:</p>
<div class="cell">

<p>In our teacher data frame, it looks like we have 23 words that occur 500 or more times.</p>
<p>For most standard data visualizations, we’ll use the {<a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org">ggplot2</a>} package which is part of the tidyverse suite of packages. All charts in {ggplot2} use the following basic code template:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb90"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb90-1"><a href="#cb90-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">ggplot</span>(data) <span class="sc">+</span> <span class="co"># ggplot sets up a plot and specifies data used for chart</span></span>

<p>Let’s use the minimal ggplot code template to make a very basic bar chart:</p>

<p>Excellent. However it would be much easier to read and interpret if our bars were ordered by count. Let’s fix that by using the <code>reorder()</code> function to reorder words by their <code>n</code> count:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb92"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb92-1"><a href="#cb92-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">ggplot</span>(teacher_chart) <span class="sc">+</span></span>

<p>Similar to how we chained functions together by using the <code>|&gt;</code> operator earlier, <code>ggplot()</code> can be customized by “adding” functions, or layers, using the <code>+</code> operator.</p>
<p>Let’s give that a try by adding a new layer for changing our axis labels into something more meaningful and adding a title:</p>

<p>Better! The {ggplot2} package has a countless number of elements that can be added for customizing a graph.</p>

<p>Well done!!</p>
<p>In the Communicate section, I’ll illustrate one one particularly useful graph element called “<a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/articles/ggplot2.html#facets">facets</a>.”</p>
</section>
</section>
</section>
<section id="model" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="model">4. MODEL</h2>
<p>As highlighted in <a href="https://datascienceineducation.com/c03.html">Chapter 3 of Data Science in Education Using R</a>, the <strong>Model</strong> step of the data science process entails “using statistical models, from simple to complex, to understand trends and patterns in the data.” The authors note that while descriptive statistics and data visualization during the <strong>Explore</strong> step can help us to identify patterns and relationships in our data, statistical models can be used to help us determine if relationships, patterns and trends are actually meaningful.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://catalog.lib.ncsu.edu/catalog/NCSU4862134">Learning Analytics Goes to School</a>, the authors describe modeling as simply developing a mathematical summary of a dataset and note that there are two general types to modeling: unsupervised and supervised learning. Unsupervised learning algorithms are used to explore the structure of a dataset, while supervised models “help to quantify relationships between features and a known outcome.”</p>
<p>We will not explore the use of models for text mining until Module 2, but if you are interested in looking ahead to see how they might be applied to text as data, I recommend taking a look at <a href="https://www.tidytextmining.com/topicmodeling.html">Chapter 6 Topic Modeling</a> from Text Mining with R: A Tidy Approach. Chris Bail in his Text as Data course also provides a nice <a href="https://cbail.github.io/textasdata/topic-modeling/rmarkdown/Topic_Modeling.html">introduction to Topic Modeling</a>, including Structural Topic Modeling, which we will explore using the <code>stm</code> package in Module 3. He also has this <a href="https://youtu.be/oos4q_3eLU4?si=MWy-HdD9NkHqnNSP">excellent video on topic modeling</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, if you have not already done so, I recommend taking a look at <a href="https://datascienceineducation.com/c03">Chapter 3 of DSIEUR</a> as well as the section on the Data-Intensive Research Workflow from Chapter 2 of Learning Analytics Goes to school.</p>

<section id="communicate" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="communicate">5. COMMUNICATE</h2>
<p>The final(ish) step in our workflow/process is sharing the results of analysis with a wider audience. Krumm et al.&nbsp;(2018) have outline the following 3-step process for communicating with education stakeholders what you have learned through analysis:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Select</strong>. Communicating what one has learned involves selecting among those analyses that are most important and most useful to an intended audience, as well as selecting a form for displaying that information, such as a graph or table in static or interactive form, i.e.&nbsp;a “data product.”</li>
<li><strong>Polish</strong>. After creating initial versions of data products, research teams often spend time refining or polishing them, by adding or editing titles, labels, and notations and by working with colors and shapes to highlight key points.</li>
<li><strong>Narrate</strong>. Writing a narrative to accompany the data products involves, at a minimum, pairing a data product with its related research question, describing how best to interpret the data product, and explaining the ways in which the data product helps answer the research question.</li>
</ol>
<p>For this particular case study, our target audience is developers of online professional learning opportunities who are looking to receive feedback on what’s working well and potential areas for improvement. This allows us assume a good deal of prior knowledge on their end about the context of the evaluation, a high level of familiarly with the online professional development resources being assessed, and fairly literate at reading and interpreting data and charts. This also allows us simplify our data products and narrative and reduce the level of detail needed to communicate useful information.</p>
<p>For summative evaluation, typically at the end of a school year or grant period when the emphasis is on assessing program outcomes and impact, our audience would extend to those less familiar with the program but with a vested interest in program’s success, such as this <a href="https://fi.ncsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/175/2024/11/ATR-Evaluation-Report-2024-FINAL.pdf">report to NC State Board of Education</a> or those directly impacted by the program including NC educators is general. In that case, our data product would need to include much more narrative to provide context and greater detail in charts and graphs in order to help interpret the data presented.</p>
<section id="a.-select" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a.-select">5a. Select</h3>
<section id="analyses" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="analyses"><strong>Analyses</strong></h4>
<p>For analyses to present, I’m going to focus primarily on:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Word Counts</strong>. One of the first things I’ll share with my audience is my analysis of word counts since these are very easy to interpret will provide online PD developers with some instant insight.</li>
<li><strong>Word Search</strong>. I also think it’s important to include some actual participant responses for select key words in order to provide additional information about how those words are being used on context. I may handpick some select quotes or present a random selection of quotes.</li>
<li><strong>Relative Frequency</strong>. Finally, as a way to potentially help them weed through words unique to specific resources, as well as potentially identify some areas for potential follow-up and to dig deeper, I’ll include words with the highest percentage of occurrence for each resource.</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="data-products" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-products"><strong>Data Products</strong></h4>
<p>In terms of “data products” and form, and because this is a simple demonstration for sharing analyses and our first badging experience, I’ll prepare my data product as a basic slide show that includes the following charts:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Word Cloud</strong>. This is really as much decorative as it is a means to communicate key findings. I’ll probably include this on my title slide as a way to immediately engage my audience and provide a preview of findings I’ll share. It’s also a way to include common words that may not make the cut in my bar chart.</li>
<li><strong>Bar Chart</strong>. I’ll definitely share with them the bar chart I created earlier as a means to focus on the most common words used by teachers across all resources. Also, this is a little less busy than a word cloud and allows them to quickly see the top words in order.</li>
<li><strong>Quotes</strong>. As noted above, I also feel it’s important to provide some participants responses that help explain how the common words are being used in context.</li>
<li><strong>Small Multiples</strong>. I think the small multiples chart of high-percentage words would help to spark discussion among PD developers about specific aspects of each resource type and what teachers’ found most valuable.</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="sharing-format" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sharing-format">Sharing Format</h4>
<p>For Module 1 we’ll be using <a href="https://quarto.org">Quarto</a> to create a <code>revealjs</code> <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/">slide deck</a> or short report that documents our independent analysis. Quarto files can also be used to create a <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/guide/">wide range of outputs and formats</a>, including polished PDF or Word documents, websites, web apps, journal articles, online books, interactive tutorials and more. And to make this process even more user-friendly, Quarto includes <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/visual-markdown-editing/#/">a visual editor</a> that lets you create files like you would with a standard word processing tool.</p>
<p>An additional advantage of Quarto compared to the alternative of copying and pasting tables and charts created from an R script to Word or PowerPoint is that you can embed your R code directly in your file making it easy to update your charts as needed and share your file with others so they can inspect your code and reproduce your analysis, i.e.&nbsp;<a href="https://vickysteeves.gitlab.io/repro-papers/r-markdown-in-reproducible-research.html">reproducible research</a>.</p>

<section id="word-cloud" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="word-cloud">Word Cloud</h4>
<p>To make the word cloud a little less busy and a little more useful, I removed the multitude of colors from the default setting, and using some modified code form the <code>?wordclouds2</code> help file. I’ve included an argument in the <code>wordclouds2( )</code> function to use the red hex color <code>#CC0000</code> for words that occur more than 1000 times, and gray for the rest.</p>

I also used the built-in <code>theme_minimal( )</code> function layer to simplify the look. If this were something for a more formal report, I’d probably finesse it even more, but it gets the point across.</p>

<p>Word clouds and bar charts are pretty effective for highlighting the most common words in an entire corpus, or in our case, all teacher survey responses, regadrless of resource type being reviewed.</p>
<p>One limitation we ran into earlier when we started looking at word frequencies and tf-idf stats was that it was difficult to easily compare the most common or unique words for each resource type. That is where small multiples can assist. A small multiple is basically a series of similar graphs or charts that make it easier to compare across different document collections of interest, in our case, word counts by resource type.</p>
<p>For this faceted chart, I’ll focus on word frequencies, which I think are more useful that our tf-idf findings. I’ll also adapt the example illustrated in <a href="https://www.tidytextmining.com/tfidf#the-bind_tf_idf-function">Text Mining with R</a> to create a similar chart for our <code>teacher_percentages</code> data frame:</p>

<p>With our “data products” cleanup complete, we’ll start pulling together a quick presentation to share with our education partners. We’ve already seen what a more formal report looks like in the PREPARE section of this case study. For your Module 1 Badge, you’ll be creating a simple data product report to share out some key findings from our analysis.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether you plan to talk us through your analysis and findings with a presentation or walk us through with a brief written report, your data product should address the following questions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Purpose</strong>. What question or questions are guiding your analysis? What did you hope to learn by answering these questions and why should your audience care about your findings?</li>
<li><strong>Methods</strong>. What data did you selected for analysis? What steps did you take took to prepare your data for analysis and what techniques you used to analyze your data? These should be fairly explicit with your embedded code.</li>
<li><strong>Findings</strong>. What did you ultimately find? How do your “data products” help to illustrate these findings? What conclusions can you draw from your analysis?</li>
<li><strong>Discussion</strong>. What were some of the strengths and weaknesses of your analysis? How might your audience use this information? How might you revisit or improve upon this analysis in the future?</li>

<p>For now, we will wrap up this case study by converting your work to an HTML file that can be published and used to communicate your learning and demonstrate some of your new R skills. To do so, you will need to “render” your document. Rendering a document does two important things, namely when you render a document it:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>checks through all your code for any errors; and,</p></li>
<li><p>creates a file in your project directory that you can use to share you work.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Now that you’ve finished your case study, let’s render this document by clicking the <img src="img/render.png" class="img-fluid" style="width:2.0%"> Render button in the toolbar at that the top of this file. Rendering will covert this Quarto document to a HTML web page as specified in our YAML header. Web pages are just one of <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/all-formats.html">the many publishing formats you can create with Quarto</a> documents.</p>
<p>If the files rendered correctly, you should now see a new file named <code>tm-1-case-study.html</code> in the Files tab located in the bottom right corner of R Studio. If so, congratulations, you just completed the getting started activity! You’re now ready for the module Case Studies that we will complete during the third week of each module.</p>

<p>If you encounter errors when you try to render, first check the case study answer key located in the files pane and has the suggested code for the Your Turns. If you are still having difficulties, try copying and pasting the error into Google or ChatGPT to see if you can resolve the issue. Finally, contact your instructor to debug the code together if you’re still having issues.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="publish-file">Publish File</h3>
<p>There are a wide variety of ways to publish documents, presentations, and websites created using Quarto. Since content rendered with Quarto uses standard formats (HTML, PDFs, MS Word, etc.) it can be published anywhere. Additionally, there is a <code>quarto publish</code> command available for easy publishing to various popular services such as <a href="#0">Quarto Pub</a>, <a href="#0">Posit Cloud</a>, <a href="#0">RPubs</a> , <a href="#0">GitHub Pages</a>, or <a href="#0">other services</a>.</p>
<section id="your-turn-17" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="your-turn-17">👉 Your Turn ⤵</h4>
<p>Choose of of the following methods described below for publishing your completed case study.</p>
</section>
<section id="publishing-with-quarto-pub" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="publishing-with-quarto-pub">Publishing with Quarto Pub</h4>
<p>Quarto Pub is a free publishing service for content created with Quarto. Quarto Pub is ideal for blogs, course or project websites, books, reports, presentations, and personal hobby sites.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that all documents and sites published to Quarto Pub are <strong>publicly visible</strong>. You should only publish content you wish to share publicly.</p>
<p>To publish to Quarto Pub, you will use the&nbsp;<code>quarto publish</code>&nbsp;command to publish content rendered on your local machine or via Posit Cloud.</p>
<p>Before attempting your first publish, be sure that you have created a free&nbsp;<a href="https://quartopub.com/">Quarto Pub</a>&nbsp;account.</p>
<p>The <code>quarto publish</code>&nbsp;command provides a very straightforward way to publish documents to Quarto Pub.</p>
<p>For example, here is the Terminal command to publish a generic Quarto <code>document.qmd</code> to each of this service:</p>
<div class="code-with-filename">
<div class="code-with-filename-file">
<pre><strong>Terminal</strong></pre>
</div>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb99" data-filename="Terminal"><pre class="sourceCode bash code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb99-1"><a href="#cb99-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">quarto</span> publish quarto-pub document.qmd</span></code><button title="Copy to Clipboard" class="code-copy-button"><i class="bi"></i></button></pre></div>
</div>
<p>You can access your the terminal from directly <strong>Terminal Pane</strong> in the lower left corner as shown below:</p>
<p><img src="img/terminal.png" class="img-fluid" style="width:100.0%"></p>
<p>The actual command you will enter into your terminal to publish your orientation case study is:</p>
<p><code>quarto publish quarto-pub sna-2-case-study-R.qmd</code></p>
<p>When you publish to Quarto Pub using <code>quarto publish</code> an access token is used to grant permission for publishing to your account. The first time you publish to Quarto Pub the Quarto CLI will automatically launch a browser to authorize one as shown below.</p>
<div class="code-with-filename">
<div class="code-with-filename-file">
<pre><strong>Terminal</strong></pre>
</div>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb100" data-filename="Terminal"><pre class="sourceCode bash code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb100-1"><a href="#cb100-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">$</span> quarto publish quarto-pub</span>
<span id="cb100-2"><a href="#cb100-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">?</span> Authorize <span class="er">(</span><span class="ex">Y/n</span><span class="kw">)</span> <span class="ex">›</span> </span>
<span id="cb100-3"><a href="#cb100-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">❯</span> In order to publish to Quarto Pub you need to</span>
<span id="cb100-4"><a href="#cb100-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  <span class="ex">authorize</span> your account. Please be sure you are</span>
<span id="cb100-5"><a href="#cb100-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  <span class="ex">logged</span> into the correct Quarto Pub account in </span>
<span id="cb100-6"><a href="#cb100-6" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  <span class="ex">your</span> default web browser, then press Enter or </span>
<span id="cb100-7"><a href="#cb100-7" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  <span class="st">'Y'</span> to authorize.</span></code><button title="Copy to Clipboard" class="code-copy-button"><i class="bi"></i></button></pre></div>
</div>
<p>Authorization will launch your default web browser to confirm that you want to allow publishing from Quarto CLI. An access token will be generated and saved locally by the Quarto CLI.</p>
<p>Once you’ve authorized Quarto Pub and published your case study, it should take you immediately to the published document. See my example Orientation Case Study complete with answer key here: <a href="https://sbkellogg.quarto.pub/laser-orientation-case-study-key/">https://sbkellogg.quarto.pub/laser-orientation-case-study-key</a>.</p>
<p>After you’ve published your first document, you can continue adding more documents, slides, books and even publish entire websites!</p>
<p><img src="img/quarto-pub.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
</section>
<section id="publishing-with-r-pubs" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="publishing-with-r-pubs">Publishing with R Pubs</h4>
<p>An alternative, and perhaps the easiest way to quickly publish your file online is to publish directly from RStudio using Posit Cloud or RPubs. You can do so by clicking the “Publish” button located in the Viewer Pane after you render your document and as illustrated in the screenshot below.</p>
<p><img src="img/publish.png" class="img-fluid" style="width:100.0%"></p>
<p>Similar to Quarto Pub, be sure that you have created a free Posit Cloud or R Pub account before attempting your first publish. You may also need to add your Posit Cloud or R Pub account before being able to publish.</p>
<p>Congratulations, you’ve completed your first case study! If you’ve already completed the Essential Readings, you’re now ready to earn your first Text Mining LASER Badge!</p>
