1,Kirk Hammer,"Milford, DE","1. I live in Milford, Delaware and I immediately searched for my county upon seeing the title of this graph. I noticed that I am particularly at risk for hurricanes, which--although we've had several--doesn't seem like it would be the most significant issue in my small state. I don't believe that we get nearly enough rainfall to be considered at risk for hurricanes.
2. Secondly, I wonder what this graph would correlate with. To elaborate, would states with higher sea level risks have more people who own boats? Or would people in CA--who are at risk for wildfires--be more likely to own a fire extinguisher compared to people who live in hurricane risk areas.
3. Finally, although this is completely irrelevant to the graph, I wondered why counties are shaped the way they are.

The thing that I noticed is the chart is a big threat which is Water Stress coming in first, our second threat would be Extreme Heat, and then our third is Extreme Rainfall. But the main issue I want to talk about when noticing would be Water Stress. Water Stress to me most likely is about our water quality, water shortages, and water scarcity, which is a lack of fresh water. I wonder if this threat will be settled in the near future, and if it doesn't will we ever find a way to have drinkable water? This will impact me and my community because everyday, some people drink water to either be dehydrated, to help our bodies, or just be pleased with their lunches with water. If there is no more water then the question is, what are we going to drink? We can't keep drinking sodas because they're made from carbonated water and carbonated water is made from water.

1,Yaeli,"San Mateo County, California","I live on the border of San Mateo County, the two biggest climate threats are high water stress and high sea level rise. The first thing I noticed is that though the charts are based on climate threats and what not, natural disasters are overlooked. Earthquakes are a big part of California??s disasters especially since the sea level is rising. Since San Mateo??s sea level and water stress is very high, earthquakes could enhance more natural disasters like tsunamis and flooding, Of course we can??t forget about the frequent wildfires that constantly ruin our environment and air quality. My only question is, if California is always in danger of droughts, why is the water stress so high? In California there is little to no rain, with the exception of rainy winters and snowy areas like Lake Tahoe. I do wonder if it??s because San Mateo is located on the border of the U.S where many oceans lie. Earthquakes, wildfires, and  flooding play a big factor in many homes here.

And I also noticed that Hurricanes are impossible to happen in this part of the US. I wonder what they mean by Water stress. Does it mean droughts, tsunamis, a decrease in the rain? I think this has an impact on my county because it can limit our freshwater supply or we wouldn't have enough rain which can cause more wildfires.

1,"Lily Baker,AOSE",Academy of Saint Elizabeth.,"I notice by looking at this graph that a large portion of the country which is mostly in the Middle West suffers from water stress risk for climate change. I also notice that most areas that border water are at a higher risk for hurricanes. I wonder why in Arkansas there is a risk for extreme heat but some portions of the state are at risk for extreme rainfall. This map does not include bodies of water so that might be an explanation as to why there is a higher risk for rainfall in these areas. This impacts my community because I live in New Jersey and we are at a high risk for hurricanes which could seriously damage our state. Considering how bad Irene and Sandy hit New Jersey, the potential risk of a hurricane impacts my community greatly.

Most of the states on the East coast have a hurricane risk whereas many of the states on the West coast have a water stress risk. About half of California has a wildfire risk, which aligns with recent events. The risk that covers the most area would be water stress as it occupies the Midwest and parts of the West and South. However, since the Midwest is more sparsely populated compared to other parts of the country, I'm unsure that water stress affects the most people. I noticed states that are at risk for hurricanes or extreme rainfall are states that border or are very close to the water; landlocked states tend to be at risk for water stress or extreme heat. I wonder what specific factors of climate change cause each risk and which risks cause the most damage.

The graph shows the climate risk of each geographical portion of the country with a huge portion of having high water stress risk. The climate risks being presented are very clear to region, showing the fact even though climate change can affect the weather in many places, it doesn't really drastically change the climate risk each geographical region has. It is also interesting to see the logic behind the risks. Because of extreme heat in states in mid-coast which accumulate clouds for rain, the east coast end up having a huge risk of rainfall due to Earth's cycle.

Some regions are affected by some risks more than others. For example, the California and Arizona regions are at great risk for wildfires while Florida is at a great risk for hurricanes. 

What do you wonder?
I wonder how much impact these climate threats have had on the United States?? communities already. Are some places still unaffected by them, but are at a high risk. Are some, like California, currently experiencing the consequences of these climate threats?

What impact does this have on you and your community?
As a resident of New Jersey, my community is most affected by the threat of hurricanes. Hurricanes have already been negatively impacted by the community in the past. For example, Hurricane Sandy destroyed property, and robbed people of their homes, leaving many homeless.

I wonder, though, how other countries compare on all four graphs. On each graph, there are different countries shown so I would like to know, for example, where Canada falls on each graph instead of just the health expenditures one.

The U.S. also spends the most on health expenses. I wonder if we spend the most is because we have the most people or is it just Americans spending money.

These graphs make me wonder what kind of rules and regulations are enforced in each of the countries to change their points on the graphs? The minimum wage graph particularly impacts my community, as New Hampshire is known for having one of the lowest minimum wages in the country, and it is surprising to me to see that the US is relatively lonely in the middle of the graph.

We also have the highest cell phone service out off all the countries on that category. Another thing that I notice is that The U.S. Is the only country on the graph that is in all of the categories. However, I wonder if this is because the creator of the graph just wanted the U.S to be in all of them. On the category for annual hours worked, I wonder of is good or bad that we are on the higher end of the category.

3,Gracie O,MA,"1.I noticed from this set of graphs that the US has the highest cellphone cost in 2019 compared to other places. The only other country that is close to the US cellphone cost is China. I also had noticed that the U.S had way more Health Expenditures in 2017 than any other place, but when it came to wages or hours worked it was average. 
2. I wonder if the dates of each graphs have an impact on one another. For example the Health Expenditures in 2017 for the US was in the range of 16 to 18. Health Expenditures are usually expensive and the U.S is known to use a lot of money in expenditures. I wonder if because the US has so many expenditures in 2017 is why the wage is so average or why the cellphone cost is so high. Maybe the U.S uses those two main things to slowly gain the money they've been spending on those expenditures.
3. The wages and cellphone cost impact me the most because a teen worker I can see the amount of hours I work and how much I earn. I noticed that the U.S has many expenditures, but still gives Americans average pay when I would think it would benefit us more compared to other countries. The cellphone cost effects me because it's hard to find a phone company that is not overprices.

In the graphs shown, the U.S.' cost for cellphone service and healthcare is the highest out of other countries. I can't say I'm surprised by this. I know many families struggle with healthcare prices and it honestly is disappointing to know how much less people pay for healthcare in other countries. I also notice that in the other two graphs, we seem to be in the middle of other countries for minimum wage & annual hours worked. This is interesting in relation to the prices for healthcare and cellphone services, as many other countries have higher minimum wage and lower healthcare. For other countries, I wonder what is causing them to have such low healthcare + cell phone service prices. It may come with consequences, but it truly is fascinating to see how many other countries have lower prices. We seem to have extremely expensive healthcare and cellphone prices and they're constantly going up. I also wonder how this relates to inflation rates. If our dollar's worth is inflating, how do the prices inflate to accommodate this? This impacts me and my community, as some people do struggle with healthcare, especially in this time of Covid-19.

Also, minimum wage is not that much, a lot of workers would prefer the U.S. to be on the right side of the graph. 
2. I wonder why the government has to have such a high health expenditures, is it because the government is trillions of dollars in debt? Why can't we have free health care like Canada or Sweden? I also wonder if these graphs have changed in 2020, this pandemic may have caused some shifts in these graphs.

2. I wonder as to why the United States has one of the worlds highest costs for basic needs while struggling to give minimum wage to its employees. I want to know if that is because the United States tends to overprice their bills for the benefit its companies. This worries me because I want to know if companies are considering the money that the average American makes versus what they charge. 
3. This impacts my community negatively because the United States charges a lot of money for health insurance, car insurance, house insurance -- literally anything that ends with insurance -- while the average person in my community does not make that much money.

3,Lauren Iskander,AOSE,"What do you notice?
I notice that even though the United States falls in the average range in terms of minimum wages and working hours, citizens must pay much more for cellphone services and health expenditures. 

What do you wonder?
I wonder why services cost so much more in America than in other countries? We are not paid more hourly, nor do we work less hours, so the data depicted in the graph surprised me. 

How this impacts my community:
This data impacts not only my life, but the lives of other people in my country. I often hear my parents speak about how costly cellphone services are, and the in-affordability of healthcare has become a popular discussion in modern politics.

3,Sarah Cruz AOSE,Academy of Saint Elizabeth,"I noticed that this graph is made up of 4 different graphs. Each graph shows determinations of national well-being such as; cellphone service cost, annual hours worked, health expenditures, and annual minimum wage, in various different countries.  US is highlighted in purple in every graph to distinguish where the nation falls within the topic of the graph. Most show that the US has a significant difference in wealth, spending, and work hours compared to other countries. For example in 2017 the health expenditures in most countries was more or less between 8-12%, while the US's health expenditures was between 16-18%.
I wonder how much these graphs would look like in the year 2020 because of how much the economies around the world changed. Cell phone services and health expenditures would have probably risen while minimum wage would have probably lowered. I also wonder if the US' health expenditures were higher than other countries in 2017 because we don't have free health care like other countries do.

Although in 2019 and 2017 the US spent the most, the annual hours and minimum wage fell in the middle in regards to other countries in 2018. I wonder why that is and how the US has higher prices yet the minimum wage is much less. This impacts my community because I live in the United States. If prices are much higher yet the minimum wage is lower, this makes being successful and maintaining a stable job while working a minimum wage job extremely difficult.

I wonder how expensive the US is compared to other countries in other areas such as college tuition, clothes, and taxes. Since people in America pay relatively lower taxes to people in socialists countries, could that a factor in why cellphone services and health expenditures are more expensive?

It??s interesting to see because cellphones and healthcare are deemed necessary in modern society, but the graphs show that US worker??s wages have not increased proportionally. In terms of health expenditures, US costs were substantially higher than every other country likely being an outlier.

From the graph about the health expenditures the graph seems to be left skewed since the US dot is far away from the other countries graphed. The other graphs show to be mostly unimodal.

I wonder why it costs so much for cellphone service in the United States, and what factors play into the pricing of cell service? Is it solely because the cell service companies want to make more money, or could it be because there are more expenses when providing cell service in the United States?

2. I wonder if the people who earn minimum wage are able to afford the high cell phone costs and health expenditures. Also I wonder how much money the people in other countries are making as minimum wage, because there are many other countries below the US.
3. The high cell phone service costs affect me and my family as well as most of the country because a large majority of people own cell phones and have to pay monthly costs to keep them running.

These numbers would impact my community because 35% of Tulsa lives in poverty. Although these are older numbers, inflation and the pandemic would prove to be catastrophic for those in America only making minimum wage. With many minimum wage jobs such as restaurants, construction, retail, and fast food being severely slowed in current times, it will be harder for these people to earn money.

There are many concerns surrounding the virus, but I see the biggest as the prominent amount of uncertainty. Ever since the start of it all, the public has been left with lingering questions upon when life will become normal again. The reveal helped me understand many parts of the article more clearly. At first, I was unaware of the difference that threshold immunity had compared to vaccine immunity. Many people, mostly between Democrats and Republicans, argued over the act of removing masks and what it could bring our country. I was unaware that threshold immunity is much more harmful than immunity formed by vaccines. It is only after a person receives both shots of the vaccines when they are announced fully vaccinated. This ultimately slows down the whole process of distributing vaccines, making it take much longer to reach the longed for threshold. After reading more information within the article, I also saw how total immunity includes the estimated number of those who contracted the virus and recovered from it. Even with the total immunity reaching its threshold in every chart, the deaths that will simultaneously occur are always much higher. This creates an inquiry for researchers of which plan is the most efficient way to take on the virus without too much hurt to the public.",FALSE

More Restrictions Or Less Limitations. What Is The Right Call?
Once I reviewed the graphs detailed in this article, I noticed how obvious it is that Graph B is the most feasible and secure solution in order to reach the wanted herd immunity. Saying this, is this even an achievable plan? Even with President Biden's vision of having every adult in the United States vaccinated by May, many states lifted mask rules which could possibly set us back. Then again, is this act perhaps a step in a positive direction? Many debates are forming around this topic and the answer is unclear whether or not this risky move was beneficial. With disregard to the newly mask-less states, I can still see Biden's goal upon vaccines being reached. Teens, the most populated group of virus spreaders, are a huge factor to our goals. The vaccines are unable to cater to anyone under 16, leaving a vast portion of teens without the ability to get one. Even people the age of 16 who are eligible for the vaccine still have questions about it's safety. Will there be significant side effects that could possibly scare away many teens from receiving the vaccine? There are many concerns that I have, especially with Graph B and how it shows 90,000 casualties occurring if we are to reach immunity. It's also known in Graph D how unenlightened the United States is due to the possibility of new contagious variants springing up out of nowhere.

4,Lil,Bergman ( Student Block 1),"Pt.2 

Even though it appears that most subjects relating to the virus are estimated, it's difficult to understand the need for restrictions or not. Summer is nearing us and so are beach parties, creating a perfect setting for Covid-19 to thrive. Wilmington is known for being a common home for tourists during our Summers so the influx of tourists from states without masks could be harmful. This could potentially shut down North Carolina this summer if the spread becomes too out of control. Other North Western states will likely not have to deal with this possibility. If a decline like this was to happen again, schools would noy be the only areas impacted this Summer. Beaches could be closed along with restaurants, hurting our community even more due to all of the ??mask-free?? visirots. The decision to live by these seemingly necessary rules is a very poor decision in my eyes. Even when a state has low infection numbers, it's hard to manage travelers once Summer is here.",FALSE

The graph reveal also showed graphs with even more vaccinations, to accelerate herd immunity even more, which is something I hadn??t previously considered(more than the 3 million in graph B). The huge vaccine increase pushes the total immunity up one month and the vaccine immunity up two months. It would also decrease the deaths by 10,000. Ending all social distancing precautions now would push the immunity timeline forward, but it would multiply the deaths by a little more than three. It is a very high-risk scenario and I do not think it??s the best option, especially when there are safer routes that have a closer timeline. Even easing up on the precautions in the spring could result in lots more unnecessary deaths. I wish that we could end all precautions now, however I know that is not the right path. We could have our lives back to normal now, but hundreds of thousands of people would be killed. The best option is to increase the vaccines as much as we can realistically and keep safety measures in place. If we can just hold out for a little longer the end could be very soon.",FALSE

More Restrictions Or Less Limitations. What Is The Right Call?

After studying these four graphs closely, it is clear to see that Graph B is the safest and fastest solution to reach the ideal threshold. However, how practical is this scenario? Although President Biden has made a promise to have every U.S. adult vaccinated by the end of May, states such as Texas, Mississippi, Iowa, Montana, and North Dakota have lifted mask restrictions with their states. Is this a move in the right or wrong direction? Is this the light at the end of a dark tunnel or a move taken too soon? At the current rate, vaccines are being distributed, I do believe Biden will uphold his promise. But the next concern is teenagers, argued the biggest group of spreaders for the virus. Testing is happening to ensure teens over the age of sixteen are able to receive the vaccine safely, but how long might this take? How many parents will allow their children to become vaccinated if it has potentially side effects? My biggest concern with the charts in the uncertainty. Graph B states that we could reach the herd immunity threshold by May, but in that time, 90,000 people could die.

In my first paragraph, I mainly focused on graph ??B??, but with seeing other graphs I spotted that ??C?? could also potentially work. The reason why ??C?? could potentially work is because people would like the idea of not wearing a mask as much. Even though graph ??C?? will take longer by a month it will still not force the public to rush into getting their shots, like graph ??B??.

We also can't force them to get the vaccine, so what is it that we can do? Hope they get COVID and quickly recover? Hope they don't get COVID at all and don't become immune? The vaccine and precautions can only help so much but I guarantee that those precautions won't be in place forever.

I failed to really analyze the other graphs and compare them to each other. Originally, I didn't even notice that the vaccine threshold is never reached in the variant scenario(Graph D).

After reading the reveal, I see that the graphs represent not only vaccine immunity, meaning the number of people who have been fully vaccinated, but also a total immunity including both vaccinated and those recovered from Covid-19. Each graph predicts when the immunity threshold will be met in four different circumstances. The first graph (Graph A) predicts that we will reach total immunity in July, and vaccine immunity in November if the country continues to handle the virus as it currently is, keeping restrictions and a steady vaccine rollout. This model predicts that 100,000 people could die from the virus before the herd immunity threshold is met in July.

I specifically think the captions with the graphs are informative, because they explain the great risks and loss of life we could endure, even if life gets to feel more normal and vaccines remain the same.  They help us to realize that this virus and its cure have a give and take element. These graphs display different ways to combat the coronavirus pandemic as quickly and normally as possible.

4,Kendal Bartlett,Moravian,"When I look at these graphs I notice that the more vaccines that we are giving out the more we have immunity. The deaths are still very high as well though. In order to keep this heard immunity we have to increase the number of vaccines we are giving out and open it up more, while also keeping precautions in place. Graph B looks to be the most promising to get to herd community. It would offer us the best possible outcomes. I wonder if by doing this and opening up the vaccines to more people and by getting bigger supply if the herd immunity will come faster. If there could possibly be different outcomes. This impacts me and my community because COVID and the vaccines are happening pretty much everywhere right now. These graphs put into good perspective how we have to handle situations like this and a timeline for us to try to get it accomplished.

The most peculiar of the graphs are graph B and graph D, the former showing total immunity to reach threshold as close as may with vaccine supply increase, whereas a scenario with the current vaccine supply and more contagious variants delaying the threshold to July.

I truly wonder what direction the country would take from the four graphs displayed, and what specific laws/steps the government would take in getting to a closer threshold.

This has an impact on myself and my community in the sense that any previous events and regular activity, such as the beginning of my college career, would all be dependent on the state of total immunity which also determines the state of my local public precautions.

As they say if the pace immediately increases to 3 million sharing of dosage will make the herd immunity threshold by May but originally they believed with the amount they had was going to have the immunity in July. I wonder if they would increase more of the vaccine now or would they change/put the vaccine on hold because of the virus having a more contagious variant.

For me, I will probably not be able to get a vaccine until summer or even later. Therefore, these graphs can impact my community and I because if not all of us are getting vaccinated and vaccinations are also occurring slowly, I wonder what our deaths rates could be. Therefore, the graphs show a best case scenario where 90 thousand people die, but if my community is not vaccinated, we can be part of the many factors that can increase that number.

That would be amazing. 


I wonder if these graphs are really true. Trends change all the time and don??t follow data every time. The data is probably not 100% accurate, but whatever. Also, we don??t know that if you catch coronavirus, you are truly immune. So we should definitely try to stick to the vaccine at the moment, and see where that gets us. Additionally, I believe that we should try to ease up the lockdown even when we allegedly hit ??herd immunity.??

I wonder how long it will take for everyone to receive the vaccination. We??ve been dealing with this pandemic for so long, we start to think that it might be a part of our daily lives. If the vaccine were to suddenly arrive at our doorstep, we??d take the chance to use it no matter what. But even so, we??d still have to wear masks if some people didn??t take the vaccine because of superstition, allergic reactions, or any other reason.

This impacts all of us in a way that tells us ??Hey! You??re getting the vaccine soon!??. It gives us extreme joy knowing that we would no longer have to wear masks or use social distancing. We could soon return to the life we had before the pandemic hit us. But that doesn??t mean it happens now. It only takes a matter of time before we receive such a blessing.

For instance even though graph B is ideal because it has the least amount of deaths and a rapid rate of immunity, it is not feasible to have this many vaccines. This leads me to conclude that the rate we are going at now is the best possible option because there is less deaths than in graphs C and D and we would reach the herd immunity by July.

These graphs have an enormous impact on society and I because life and death are at stake due to covid and the restrictions mandated. People can be immune to the virus and not reach the point of death, but some people will literally die if they are exposed to the virus.

An increase in vaccine supply shows to be the most effective in reaching herd immunity sooner and preventing more deaths.

With such refusals against COVID safety procedures and the denial of proven science, I doubt we could get so many people to oblige to Graph B??s plan. This also leads into why I think 3 million shots a day would be impossible, so 1.7 million is more reasonable, but it??s sad to say that I??m not certain if we could even gather that number of people everyday.

It appears that many states are prepared to lift restrictions as those that already have. I think the majority of Americans have grown tired of the mask mandate as well as the restrictions on gatherings.  I feel as though many people would prefer option C, however, we must consider those who have underlying health conditions.  If there was certainty that the vaccination would be effective against each variant of COVID-19, then Graph D would be a possibility, although there are no guarantees. If the vaccines show that they are not working on each variant then they will probably slow the production of the vaccine. This would mean delays in reaching  herd immunity. Although graph A would eventually work, It would most likely take longer for everyone to either become immune or get vaccinated. One downfall to all of these plans is that the vaccines in question are not FDA approved, presently they are just approved for emergency use.

Although this is the most optimal, it's unlikely that there will suddenly be an increase in the vaccine supply. In that case, the best scenario would be to continue the current pace, with the current vaccine supply, public precautions, and no variants.

However, the main problem is that these goals may be too unrealistic and may not align with our current situation given the presence of variants. Because of the new rise to potential COVID variants, graphs A or C may be a more realistic outcome. To prevent further COVID deaths in the recuperation period, it is important to administer as many vaccines to the public as possible.",FALSE

I notice that there are four scenarios of four graphs, of different ways that we could find herd immunity by a certain time of the year. I am drawn toward graphs A and B, particularly because they seem the best and the soonest immunity reached. Graph B is the best case scenario but it will be hard to reach that because vaccine supplies are hard to increase. Graph A seems more realistic and is my guess for the future. I believe that we should do everything in our power to end this whole thing as soon as possible and take every precaution to do so. I personally dislike online school and am ready to get back to learning face to face so gaining herd immunity before my Junior year would be great. I would still have 2 years left of high school, and plus those are the two best years. If we can all get through this by June or November and finally have a normal summer I would be ecstatic.",FALSE
4,Landon Walters,Hoggard High School,"What I notice about these graphs is that even in the perfect scenario, still thousands of people would end up dying to the virus. This scenario however, is highly unlikely. It'll be really expensive for us to keep up with the required 3 million shots a day. Therefore, the graphs that are most likely to happen are graphs A if we're smart and graph C or D if we stop treating the virus like a serious issue. We need to focus on not letting up and staying strong throughout these next couple of months so that we could limit the amount of deaths and cases. I hope that we are able to stay up with all the precautions that we have set and I hope that we could reach graph B in the future.",FALSE
4,"Lily Baker,AOSE",Academy of Saint Elizabeth.,"In looking at this graph, I notice in looking at Graph A and Graph B, the death rate is lower. I also notice that in both graph A and B, the amount of shots given to reach this immunity seems nearly impossible. Administering 1.7-3 million shots per day seems too hard to manage which is why I doubt these graphs will ever become reality. I wonder when the vaccine will be available to everyone regardless of their age so that our world can move towards forming a larger herd immunity. This impacts my community because covid is a very big thing in New Jersey and many people have been affected and died. Because of that, it is important for enough vaccines to be administered so that the numbers of cases decrease and life can go back to normalcy.

An increase in vaccine supply shows to be the most effective in reaching herd immunity sooner and preventing more deaths.

The most real graph would be graph C or graph D because of unforeseen things like the effects of spring break or even summer vacation.

If we maintained our current Pace we could reach herd immunity by July causing 100,00 deaths, and this is probably whats going to happen. Although some people believe we should end restrictions or at least ease up that would create 70,000 more lives lost but we would have herd vaccination a month earlier, in June. There is one situation where the virus contagiousness increases and this is our worst case scenario. It would cause an extra 100,000 lives lost although we'd still be achieving herd immunity by July.

I think Graph C will closely model what actually happens. As I mentioned before, when states like Texas open up and get rid of mask mandates, in no way does that put us, as a country, anywhere closer to overcoming the pandemic. 

	I am also not sure of how spring break will affect these graphs. In Graph C??s scenario, lifting restrictions along with the massive influx of college kids to Florida (which has never had a mask mandate) is a recipe for disaster.

Looking at this chart, it makes sense that ""vaccine immunity"" will reach that 70% mark later than ""total immunity"" would because every day people are developing covid antibodies, and this line includes vaccinations. What's been consistent with each graph is the fact that the new mandates for the virus will most likely end this year, in 2021, with the earliest ""total Immunity"" being May, and the latest being July. I've also noticed that in each chart, the ""total immunity"" line levels off just above 80% immune, which makes sense because not everyone in the US will be exposed to covid to not everyone can be immune to covid.

Going further and researching what they represent, I find it frightening that they are so similar even though they represent significantly different scenarios. I also notice how it is inevitable that thousands of American citizens will die. In each graph a certain number is predicted to die, a high number that is horrifying and unable to be stopped. I wonder how much information these graphs are taking into account. There will be spikes of cases around holidays and there may be periods where the cases falter and we see less. There are so many factors that could affect this such as issues with the distribution of the vaccine. It makes me question the reliability of the graph and makes me feel desperate for a solution to stop this disease that we??ll never find. These charts impact the precautions my community takes. Are they going to ease up on precautions to raise herd immunity but risk more people dying? Or will they keep strong precautions but the ability of herd immunity will go down?

None of the situations are ideal whatsoever, but I think B would be the best chance for us to return to normal I think we will end up more like Graph C when it is all said and done. 

I wonder what effects states such as Texas which got rid of the mandates have on our current pace graph right now in comparison to every states who is still wearing mask and social distancing.

In my community, it is pretty split between people who don't care about the virus and people that take the virus seriously, so I think the higher the vaccination rate the slower it will spread. I am worried that if restrictions are lifted where I am like they are in others that cases will spike.

Like I said, the ideal course of action would be plan B because it saves the most lives in the shortest amount of time. However, it keeps the US from going all the way back to normal for longer and it doesn??t include the possibility of variants.

4,B Rivera,Hoggard Highschool(Block 4),"What I notice- I notice that no matter the course of action we seem to take so many people still die in the end. Although to keep death rates low we should be increasing vaccine output but also making restrictions even stricter to completely ensure that the vaccine is working and running its course because I have seen death reports of people that went out so often no one knows if the vaccine harmed them or if it was something else. Based on the graphs we should be increasing vaccines to 3 million shots per day and not ending restrictions until some time after April so we could avoid a lot more people dying. 
What I wonder- Is this vaccine truly effective? Vaccines take years and years to make yet this one was created in a matter of a year it's not that I am not grateful for the possibility of an end to this madness but the possibility this vaccine is harmful is truly scary.

Graph B shows if we increased the pace to 3 million shots per day we could hit the threshold by May and we could save 10,000 people.  This would be a huge jump and we would be pushing out vaccines very fast but if we could save more people why would we not try to speed up the vaccination process.

From the graphs, I noticed that no matter what route we choose to take many people will still die. However, comparing graphs B and D, there is a large difference in predicted deaths. In graph B, 90,000 deaths are projected, and in graph D, 200,000 deaths. If we do not choose the most efficient plan to control the virus, it could mean more than double the amount of deaths. I also noticed from reading the article how these ??models assume that immunity lasts indefinitely and that vaccination prevents infection rather than just reducing the symptoms.?? However, it is too soon to know what the vaccine can do for us or the symptoms that come along with it.

I notice that easing up on restrictions results in quicker herd immunity than keeping restrictions, but results in 70,000 more deaths. While keeping restrictions result in less deaths, all scenarios result in a high number of deaths.

I wonder if the herd immunity is really as high as the graph represents it. The article says that it includes the estimated number of people who have had and recovered from Covid-19, but just because someone has had it doesn??t necessarily mean they are immune.

4,Luke Jackson,Hoggard Highschool N.C.,"What I noticed: I noticed that no matter what course of action we end up taking people will end up dying and there is not a lot we can do about it. Increasing the rate that vaccines are being handed out seems to be the best course of action since the least amount of people are at risk and we will reach threshold immunity in May. There is of course the chance that a new variant of the virus will appear and that would definitely increase the amount of deaths as seen in the graphs. 
What I wonder: I wonder what would happen if we increase the amount of vaccines we give out daily to over 3 million. Would we reach herd immunity quicker with less deaths or would it end up being less efficient than just stopping at 3 million. I also wonder what would happen if we end restrictions now instead of in April. 
Impact: The potential risk of the virus has an impact on everyone in my community. I would want to make sure my community is at the least amount of risk so increasing the amount of vaccines given out daily would be good. We need to make sure everyone in the community is able to get the vaccine.
How can we get to herd immunity faster but with fewer people dying?
I feel like the best plan of action to get to herd immunity faster with fewer deaths is by increasing the amount of vaccines sent out daily. If a newer variant does emerge then we may end up having to increase the amount of vaccines given out to above 3 million per day.

What do you wonder? I wonder how the inevitable spike that will come when every student in America goes on spring break, will affect these predictions.

I understand how people who are vaccinated may think they are immune to getting the virus, but they should still be masking up, for the sake of others and for themselves. If we lifted restrictions like Texas has, the impact of the virus would increase significantly, and the rate of vaccinations would not be able to restrain the virus from spreading. In the graphs, we see different ways we can reach herd immunity, but the question posed is how. I believe if we can increase vaccine supply, keep the same public restrictions in place, with everyone following them, and having no variants, we could very well reach herd immunity by June, assuming everyone is able to get fully vaccinated.

COVID-19 has impacted my community greatly.

I also notice that easing up public precautions will greatly spike the death numbers and slow the process of herd immunity, therefore, social distancing plays an even larger role than vaccination. I wonder why would lift public precautions before the majority of people are vaccinated, as I personally feel it makes the most sense to reach herd immunity the quickest, through vaccination and social distancing. This impacts me and my community because it shows that our immunity will be dependent not only on the amount of vaccines we can receive, but also on what social distancing guidelines are in place and how closely people adhere to them.

First of all, when I read this article I noticed that there is way more in this Pandemic than I realized. No matter what route we chose there is going to be a lot of death. There is a minimum of 90,000 people who could die from the virus. Graphs C and D are much more deadly than the other 2 graphs. I do not think that these should be an option as they have almost 100,000 more casualties involved. I also noticed that in Graph B we are going to have to almost double the number of shots we are giving out per day.

What do you wonder?

I wonder what will happen to the U.S. economy if we went into another total lockdown. I also wonder how we can most effectively give out the vaccine without having tremendous causualties.

What impact does this have on you and your community?

This Pandemic had impacted the world in many ways. In my community specifically, you must have a mask on at all times when in public. Schools are shut down to a point. These plans will all impact the community in a different way. Some will cause more deaths while some will caus not as many, but some will get everyone vaccinated faster while some won't. No matter what COVID has always and will always have an extreme effect on all communities around the world.

4,Will Carter,"Hoggard High School in Wilmington, NC","The first thing I noticed about the graphs were the death counts. With more than half a million Americans dead from the pandemic, I think it should be a top priority to keep that number as low as possible. I also noticed how the conditions of each graph changed, and how that reflects what could happen in the near future. In states like Texas and Mississippi, where restrictions are being lifted, we may see results similar to graph C, which will lead to many more Americans dying. In my opinion, we should do our best to stay on a model reflected by graphs A and B. Graph B is the ideal situation, but current vaccine supplies are unlikely to support 3 million people a day. I also noticed how much steeper the orange dotted lines are in graphs C and D. It is important to notice these lines because they show the population that will be immune due to exposure and recovery. It is a very poor choice to lift restrictions at the moment, as our death toll could rise like graphs C and D, especially considering the new strains of the virus that could be more deadly or contagious. My biggest wonder from this graph is how people will respond to it. The governor of Texas would likely benefit from seeing this graph. I think he would respond negatively to it, as he would see what could happen to his population. I also wonder how the virus deniers might view the graph.

There are many different scenarios that would help others but hurt others. One of them being lifting public precautions. To the people who are vaccinated at the time and are healthy, this should not worry them but for someone who has underlying illnesses or has not receive their vaccine yet, they are more at risk. But when you look at all the plans you cannot avoid the fact that people are going to die from 90,000 to 200,000 people. I wonder what will happen if there is another spike in cases. Will we have to back to lockdown? Will easing up in the spring possibly lead us to shutdown? This could impact me and my community greatly. All of these are potential solutions and if we choose the wrong one it could lead us to another lockdown and more importantly many people dying. Is it really worth going back to normal and gaining deaths rather than waiting and possibly avoiding these deaths. Now we will never be able to avoid people dying but we can prevent it by taking the best precautions to keep us safe. I know my town has many small businesses that could not undergo another shutdown.

4,Jaleigh Henderson (3rd block),Hoggard High School,"In the charts I observed, I noticed how Graph B is the most reasonable way to continue on with trying to reach herd immunity.  It has the least amount of people that would die from the virus, and it also shows us reaching total immunity in May. Another plus about this graph is how many vaccines will be given out each day. With three million shots given each day, it shows us ending this global pandemic very soon which is a very pleasing thought. One thing about these graphs that makes me wonder is how did they know how many people would die from each scenario? I'm sure they based it on how many covid deaths occur daily but sometimes I am not always willingly trusting everything the media says. Something that surprised me in Graph 1 was how we would still be letting 100,000 people die if we continued distributing vaccines and keeping the mandates in effect. I guess most of those deaths will be from elders or people who are traveling a lot around the globe. The impact of someday reaching herd immunity will greatly impact my community, due to how we will be able to gather just like before the virus started. It will be refreshing to not have to wear a mask anymore and I feel like people will be in better spirits as well.

We should take into consideration Graph B and how there is a smaller death toll when there is an increased vaccine supply. The last thing we should do is lift precautions, especially in spring when children are out of school and travel, because Graph C shows the largest spike in cases, other than Graph D, in which case, contagious variants are not anything we can change. If we keep precautionary measures while people are getting vaccinated, there will be less deaths during the total time it will take to get everyone fully vaccinated.

Another issue stands: children??s vaccinations.

The pandemic has not only affected the economy of the whole United States and has caused the need for the creation of detailed plans, but it also has impacted the lives of many families, including mine. My mother, a Psychiatric Nurse Practitioner, has been forced to increase her hours at her practice just to fit the needs of the people in our community struggling with their mental health. The upbringing of people who previously did not carry any mental issues who are now flourishing with internal pain is insane. Luckily, it has kept my mother in a stable job, helping provide for our family. Some of my neighbors and friends do not have this privilege and their parents have been out of jobs ever since last March. So many struggle with the impacts of the pandemic, even the little things.

With increasing the supply of vaccines per day the projected amount of casualties becomes less and the threshold will come sooner. The Vaccine immunity is significantly lower than the total immunity. 

As a group we wonder, if more people will feel moved to get this vaccine if Covid was an even more deadly disease? How much would it cost for the government to give out 3 million doses each day? How is herd immunity calculated? How many states will ignore covid death toll predictions and end their restrictions early? Do the graphs account for people who are not going to get vaccinated? How would the graphs differ if done state by state?

The amount distributed can also help with foreign aid across the world to help other countries that may be struggling as well.",FALSE

Graph A is the most likely to happen if we continue to apply adequate public precautions. It represents our current pace of 1.7 million vaccines per day, and when looking at it I felt a sense of hope because I can finally see the finish line. But because the virus is unpredictable, there are other scenarios that can play out. In graph B, if the United States increased the distribution of vaccines to three million vaccines per day, we could reach herd immunity by May. Although this result would be fantastic, and the predicted death rate would reduce by 10,000, it is unlikely because we would have to nearly double our vaccine outtake.  In graph C, if restrictions were ended in April, the United States could reach herd immunity by June. Despite heard immunity being reached faster, we risk losing 70,000 more people without public precautions. This makes me wonder if we will wait until after herd immunity to end restrictions.

I also noticed that on Graph C, the one with the lifted restrictions beginning in the Spring, the total immunity threshold is reached faster than it is reached on any of the other graphs.  I assume that most of the total immunity for Graph C is coming from people who are recovering from the infection, considering that with lifted public precautions, the disease is more likely to spread.  I know that the graphs are showing herd immunity levels, which would include children and adults, but I wonder if they are factoring in the uncertainty of vaccinating children.  There is not a vaccine ready to be administered to children yet, and if the vaccine is proven to be unsafe for children, I wonder how the graph will be altered.

Graph B shows the effects of upping vaccine distribution to 3 million shots per day, provided there??s no new strain of virus. Doing this would mean reaching herd immunity by May, and experiencing 90,000 deaths. Increasing vaccination rates means we could reach the herd immunity threshold sooner.

We also noticed that herd immunity is achieved when a little under 70% of the population is completely vaccinated and it is projected to happen over the summer according to the graphs. Even with easing some restrictions, we could reach herd immunity by June, but it means a lot more people will die. Lastly, by increasing the vaccine rollout from 1.7 million to 3 million shots per day, we could prevent 10,000 deaths.

In addition, we wondered if our country increases the supply of vaccines, how would this affect us financially, and can we distribute more vaccines. The impact that this topic has on our community is that we have been dealing with COVID-19 for a year now and having herd immunity would be a big step into getting things back to normal.

When I combine all of the graphs, I find that the percentage of vaccine immunity must be on the verge of crossing the threshold, but in Graph D, vaccine immunity is already falling short, and more people are dying. The result does not seem to be the best.

I'm curious as to why the vaccine tolerance for graph D falls short of the required level. Furthermore, I'm curious about the outcome of achieving herd immunity prior to vaccine immunity.

What impact does this have on you and your community?
The knowledge contained in these graphs has an effect on me and my group because it demonstrates how we could achieve herd immunity as early as May or as late as July. And if either occurs, a 10-15% increase in total immunity is needed before total immunity reaches a plateau.
As a result, I believe that at the plateau, we should be certain that there is only a small risk of contracting the virus.

Today??s graphs show the results of a model that estimates when the U.S. will obtain herd immunity from the coronavirus.  (Herd immunity occurs when enough people become immunity to a disease to make its spread unlikely.  This is a result of vaccinations and natural infection.)   Here are graphs for four situations:  under current conditions, with increased supply of vaccines, with relaxing social distancing, and with more contagious variant spreads.

4,Madeleine,Pennsylvania,"NOTICE:
If we keep the vaccinations at the pace we are currently in, herd immunity would be in July with 100,000 deaths, however, if an increase of vaccinations would go to 3 million per day, herd immunity would be reached in May with 90,000 deaths. If we were to ease up on restrictions and keep the current daily vaccination supply, then herd immunity would be in June with 170,000 deaths. If we were to have the current vaccine supply & more contagious variants, then the herd immunity would come in July with 200,000 deaths. 
The second graph shows that the combination of vaccination increases and the use of precautions in the public could expedite the arrival of herd immunity.

4,Mitch,Pennsylvania,"I notice in these graphs that as the vaccine supply per day goes up, the quicker we will reach herd immunity provided that more aggressive variants do not appear and preventative measures are maintained. The possibility of deaths increasing is probable based on the situation but we can expect them to stay below 200,000 in the worst case scenario. 
I wonder what easing up on public precautions will look like in order to maintain the projected numbers. Even into graph D, what will preventative measures look like? Will they be similar to what is in place now? Stricter?

'Vaccinated before the Vacation?'",FALSE
4,Robin Andrews,"Exeter, UK","Another observation from these graphs - it seems clear that natural immunity is a very significant factor in achieving community immunity. That being the case, is seems feasible to suggest that a policy of focused protection with no lockdown may have (and may still) lead to community immunity faster than imposing lockdowns.

Does that make sense? What do you think?",FALSE
4,Belle,Tennessee,"Holding similar conditions as Graph B, except for more contagious variants, the results drastically change. The number of fatalities could spike towards 200,000. While the threshold for total immunity would be reached in July, paralleling Graph A, the threshold for vaccine immunity would not be reached at all (unlike the 3 other graphs). Hence, Graph D presents the worst possible scenario. 

I wonder which plan the United States will take: whether the vaccine supply will be kept at the current pace or increased, whether public precautions will be kept or ended in April, and whether there were will no new variants or more contagious variants. The possibilities and results are vast and unpredictable. 

This affects the health and well-being of our community, especially those of us with pre-existing conditions or deteriorating health that place them at high-risk positions of catching COVID-19 and failing to recover from it. The impacts are both psychologically and physically detrimental. The impact also extends to life as a whole, determining when our community can return to normal social interaction, activities, education, economic growth, etc.

This impacts me and my community because we are all impacted by covid at school and at home. We have friends and families who are prone to further illness due to covid and we are all hoping to reach herd immunity as fast as possible and without so many lives being taken.

4,Joseph Mendoza,"Boston, Massachusetts","I notice that there are four different graphs each with varying scenarios about the different paths the United States can take to achieve herd immunity. I notice that at the current pace we are in right now with about 1.7 million shots per day, we are expected to reach total immunity by July with about 100,000 deaths. Another scenario shows how if we increase the shots given to about 3 million every day, we could reach herd immunity by May with out 90,000 deaths. I wonder as to why it is that we see overlap with these different scenarios and I would like to know as to what our most likely path is going to be. Could it be that even with a vary contagious variant we could still reach herd immunity in the summer no matter which scenario occurs? I would say that this has a very profound impact on my community because the entire country is dealing with this pandemic and the faster that my community follows safety guidelines while getting vaccinated, then the faster we can return to a normal life. I very much miss my life the way it was before the pandemic, and the intense waiting is very killer. I know I am doing my part to get this pandemic over with, and I hope that my community does the same. Potential headline: ""How Soon Can We Return To a Normal Lifestyle?""",FALSE
4,Mallory,Nashville,"What do you notice?
I notice that summer is predicted to be when immunity levels begin to increase greatly. This is consistent in each scenario represented in the different graphs. I also notice that if we want to have the smallest number of deaths possible, the situation represented in graph 2 would be the most effective way to do this. This is hard to make possible, though, as we cannot control whether a more contagious variant appears in the US or not. Although graph 2 predicts the least number of deaths, 90,000 deaths is still an extremely high number, which is disconcerting.


What do you wonder?
I wonder why increasing the pace of the vaccines in graph 2 to almost twice as much as the pace in graph 1 would only save 10,000 lives. I also wonder what would happen if we increased the pace of the vaccines while keeping restrictions high but a more contagious variant appeared.


What impact does this have on you and your community?
This affects my age group specifically in terms of what will happen in the near future. We should be going to college in the fall, but I'm not sure how that will look thanks to COVID. I hope that college students will be able to be vaccinated before going to college, as that would make the process of transitioning to a new environment much less stressful.

4,Ashley Nwadike,Massachusettes,"I notice that there are 4 different graphs showing the number of people who got vaccinated and are recovering and the number of people who died before receiving the herd immunity. I wonder how long it will take America to get back to its normal self? and I also question how many people died when the virus was first announced? The impact that this graph has on my community is that it shows how many people were infected by covid and the number of lives that were lost due to the pandemic.

4,Jojo,"Nashville, TN","What do you notice?

The first thing I notice is the clear benefit to the scenario with no variants and increased vaccine supply. This makes complete sense, however to graphically observe the clear advantage is shocking. Additionally, the fact that no variants and more contagious variants have the same predicted herd immunity date is interesting. 

What do you wonder?

I wonder why a more contagious variant does not make the predicted natural immunity date sooner. 

What impact does this have on you and your community?

The clear impact is that we need to increase funding to vaccination sites, as well as maintain social precautions for vulnerable populations.

4,Cleo,AOSE,"What do you notice? The graph shows 4 scenarios of vaccine distribution and public precautions and the amount of time and casualties before reaching herd immunity. Graph A shows how long it would take and how many people would die if the vaccine is distributed at the current pace with current public precautions. Graph B appears to be the most effective scenario with the fastest estimated time needed and the least amount of people die from the virus. On the other hand, Graph D lost the most people before reaching the herd immunity threshold.

What do you wonder? Why more people die in Graph D when both graph A and D reach the threshold at the same time.

What impact does this have on you and your community? It is really important to me as well as everyone else that this whole Covid situation would either slow a lot down or stop. For me to be able to go home and come back to America to continue my education, this situation needs to become a lot better. Being in the herd immunity range might ensure this.

4,Paul Coffield,"Memphis, TN","I notice that the four graphs represent four possible ways in which the United States could reach herd immunity. The first graph shows what the future could look like if we continue with life as it is now: 1.7 million vaccinations a day with public precautions (social distancing and mask-wearing). The second graph shows a future in which 3 million vaccinations are given per day. In this possible scenario, we would reach herd immunity by May. The third graph shows what the future would look like if we continue with 1 million vaccinations a day, and then lift the restrictions in April. In this scenario, we would reach herd immunity faster, but with more deaths. The final example shows a future in which a more contagious variant spreads. In this scenario, it would take until July to reach herd immunity and up to 200,000 more people could die from the virus.

I wonder which scenario is most likely. I also wonder if the government plans on increasing their vaccination rates to 3 million shots per day, like in the second graph. I wonder if a more contagious variant has already begun to spread throughout the U.S. Finally, I wonder what exactly herd immunity entails. Does herd immunity mean that the virus vanishes completely?

This impacts my community because vaccinations mean less deaths and a return to normal life in my community. Covid 19 is abundant in my city and increased vaccination rates would help us all greatly.

If the amount of shots per day increases less people will die by the time we achieve herd immunity. Even if vaccinations continue Togo our ending restrictions will cause even more people to die. If the more contagious strand continues to spread that will lead to the most deaths before herd immunity. 
I wonder if it is possible for America to continue to bump up the amount of shots they give out per day. I also wonder how long it will take for people under 16 to be able to get the vaccine and how that will affect the number of cases. 
This impacts my community because while this virus is still very dangerous developing herd immunity through the vaccine will allow for schools to start and more businesses to open.

4,Nate,Georgia,"1)  I notice that there is a big difference between the number of people who could die from the virus, depending on the action we take.  The most effective way to prevent a large number of deaths would be to continue with public precautions while giving out the vaccine, but if we even ease up on precautions slightly, then will have almost double the number of deaths. There is also a large difference in the time it would take for everyone to receive the virus and be immune, based on what type of path is taken.

4,Leon,California,"What do you notice?
I notice that different variables can have large effects on when we can reach herd immunity. It is interesting how the supply of vaccines, public precautions, and variants can affect the time for the general public to reach herd immunity. It is really interesting that even with our great progress with vaccination if we ease restrictions in the spring an extra 70,000 people could die, but herd immunity would be reached a month earlier. It is also interesting how variants that are pretty much out of our control could significantly impact the timeline of herd immunity and deaths from the virus.

What do you wonder?

I am curious about how more infections lead to both earlier herd immunity and more deaths. How many deaths does each additional infection bring? How much earlier does it move up the herd immunity threshold? Does more infections lead to more chances for worse variants?

What impact does this have on you and your community?

These graphs show both when it may be safe to reopen, but also how many people will die from the virus in different scenarios.

However, if a more contagious variant of the virus develops then herd immunity increases to about 70% with the potential deaths of 200,000 people to reach that threshold. As I look at all the graphs together I notice that the percentage of vaccine immunity must barely reach the threshold yet for Graph D  vaccine immunity does not reach the threshold and more people are dying. That outcome seems to not be the most advantageous.

I wonder why the vaccine immunity for graph D does not meet the threshold. In addition, I wonder about the result of reaching herd immunity before vaccine immunity.

What impact does this have on you and your community?
The information presented in these graphs impacts me and my community because they show how there is a possibility that we could reach herd immunity at the earliest in May or at the latest in July. Yet, even if either takes place there is still a 10-15% increase that needs to be reached before total immunity plateaus. From this, I assume that at the plateau we can be most sure that there is a minimal chance of catching the virus.

After observing the data, I wonder what actions can be taken to decrease the levels of concern within critical regions. In terms of this data??s impact on my own community, I see how a major barrier to vaccination could lead to a disparity in vaccinated New Yorkers.

This phenomenon might be most prevalent in low-income areas, specifically within New York City, but I can still understand how this factor could serve as a roadblock closer to my own community.

The first thing I noticed was the stark contrast between the levels of concern in rural states and urban states. In rural states such as Texas and Arkansas, there are high levels of concern for many vaccination barriers such as irregular medical, poor health care access, and low health care resources. This is possibly due to a less dense population in certain regions, making it more difficult for residents to find clinics that offer abundant vaccines in a safe manner. On the other hand, urban states have minimal concerns regarding the vaccination barriers except for low health care resources. Seeing the spike in concern over that issue, I wondered if this was due to a denser population that required more health care resources at a faster rate. 

What impact does this have on you or your community?
According to the graph, New York's biggest concern on barriers is the socioeconomic barrier. In the region of New York where I live, this isn't as big of an issue as other places in New York such as New York City and lower-income neighborhoods.

My first guess would be that the Northeast specifically has always excelled in medical advancements and medical care -- so it makes sense that they are doing well distributing coronavirus vaccines. My second guess is that the southern states tend to be very Republican leaning, and many people who are Republican are hesitant towards getting the vaccine. It could very much be that they are unsure and a little nervous to get it.

Most of the problems and barriers in the southern states seem to be irregular medical care, socioeconomic barriers, and low health care resources while the degree of problems seems to vary in the many northern states with a less ""fuller"" circle. I do certainly wonder why speecific barriers are more prominent in the South as compared to the North and why they are not being adequately addressed.

This data indicates that all of these barriers already pose a significant obstacle for efficient and rapid vaccinations. The data also demonstrates how certain communities, counties, and states may have to gear more of their focus on one specific barrier as compared to a measure that would moderate all of the barriers. Such a solution focusing on one barrier will also be more effective as compared to ""dipping a hand in everything.""

One thing I am curious about is why the southern states have so many barriers preventing them from getting the COVID vaccine. 
     I believe that this graph has little impact on me and my community.
     What I believe is going on in this graph is it is showing the main factors that are preventing people in different states from getting the COVID vaccine and the level of concern it gives the government or the people in the state.

I also noticed many of the states also have a historic undervaccination in the south that may also cause this huge concern in the south since that can also create a boom in cases. Lastly, I also noticed that the states with a higher level of concerns have great Eocio economic barriers.

I noticed that the southern states are more concerned about coronavirus vaccination barriers. Northern states seem to have lower vaccination barriers. 
2. What do you wonder?
I wonder if the reason the southern states have more corona virus vaccination barriers is due to being opposed to being vaccinated due to most southern states being against covid-19 precautions such as wearing masks. Barriers would obviously take a longer time to give the vaccine to people.

I wonder how closely this graph follows trends in each demographic's political standings, and what states are outliers (for instance, a more democratic state having a rounder distribution and greater concerns).

Also, for the southern states that have high covid-19numbers, many of them share the issue with poor healthcare access, so it's far to assume that these states in particular have not adjusted quick enough to the global pandemic and are having a difficult time of keeping covid numbers down.

The worst part about the amount of high risk states is how they slow down the time needed to eradicate covid from other states in the U.S. It doesn't help that many people who live in these states, most notable Florida, have little respect for CDC guidelines. Its well known by many in the U.S that States like Florida have residence that refuse to social distance whiling traveling in numbers that can easily infect dozens of people at a time.

I wonder if the concern is directly tied to coronavirus transmission level and/or the percentage of the population that is vaccinated. 

What impact does this have on you and your community?
The impact that this has had on me personally is from the graph showing that the area I live in is not a high level of concern state. It also shows that New York is doing much better than other states during these times which makes me feel safer and reassured.

I wonder why they can't access the COVID vaccine as well as northeastern states, like New York, Connecticut, and Massachusetts. However, this isn't a surprise to me southern states historically have worse access to health care. The population is scarcer, as most of the ""overall concern"" states do not have a major city within them. Yes, every state has at least one city, but it doesn't make those cities automatically comparable to states with cities like Boston or New York City. These cities bring wealth into a state, that would be impossible for say, Oklahoma to have.

5,Sophia Trojanowski,valley stream north high school,"1). When first observing the following graphic, there is a trend of Southern states facing greater vaccination barriers, all of which are rooted in health care problems or generalized poverty. Another trend that was noticeable in the graph is the lack of distinction between rural and urban. Personally, I would like to know the environment in which these problems are present. For example, is a metropolis not compensating for the oversaturated urban areas or are rural areas not reaching their full vaccination? Furthermore, how are limitations assessed in the data set used? Research limitations in fields of epidemiology dealing with such an evolving pandemic like COVID could exist. Was the following data based on expert assumptions, social based questionnaires that have margin errors for bias? Could there be other factors not represented by the following infographic like inefficient systems of administration blocking citizens from getting their vaccines? 
2). NY is a heavily populated state so it can be assumed that the waves of vaccination might take a bit longer. However, from family and friends, I've heard various situations with regards to the barriers being presented. Some do feel that communication was sparse while others got the vaccine with ease. Thus, the sections in this infographic do not pertain to what I personally heard and reflects one of the limitations I had listed above. However, this infographic does show that New York is in a good spot with vaccinations.",FALSE
5,Aeryn,"Portland, OR","I notice that most states in the south have a high level of concern and high levels of each barrier point (a wider area of the illustrated shape). This is in contrast to most northern states, which have relatively low levels of concern and lower lengths of each point, or at least minimal lengths on most points with one outstanding point. 
I wonder if political ideals play into which states have lower or higher levels of concern, as well as which states have more barriers. Seeing as southern states (relatively more conservative states) have high levels of concern whereas more liberal states (OR, CA, WA, NY, etc) have lower levels of concern and fewer barriers. Is this tied to liberal vs conservative health policies in each state?
Living in Oregon, it looks like our heaviest barriers are low health care resources, historic undervaccination, and irregular medical care. Knowing many people who cannot afford health care or doctors visits, this makes sense to me. I am worried for our community, especially our high houseless population, who are more at risk due to the inability to use healthcare resources. I also know several immunocompromised people who are banking on herd immunity to save them, but when so many people are historically unvaccinated this may not be a safe bet.

Looking at the northern side of the U.S not many problems are at large. some states have low resources and some have poor health care access. In New York the main problem is Socioeconomic barriers.

Is it being able to get the supplies, the number of anti-vaxxers in the population, or something else? Both Hawaii and Alaska are rather apart of the rest of the country, but I noticed that that they have different levels of concern and different barriers (with the exception of undervaccination). It's interesting to see the different shapes for each state on the graph. 

This impacts me and my community because vaccinating is an important issue due to the goal of reaching herd immunity. Since I live in Massachusetts, there doesn't seem to be any major concerns over being able to get the coronavirus vaccine, but it's not the same in other states. 

A headline could be, ""Everyone Needs a Vaccine, But Can Everyone Get One?"".",FALSE
5,JR,NY,"-From the overall graph, I've noticed that the states in the lower part of the united states have a very high level of concern due to not having enough vaccines distributed and not much care is being given. Meanwhile with the upper states, they have medium concern because  of the need of distributing the vaccine faster.

-I wonder how would each state slowly resolve the issue and the level of concern at hand instead of focusing on on how the numbers are high  with the cases in each state. would that change the level of concern of each state didn't focus on the number of cases their state has? 

- I would say I'm neutral with the affect of the vaccine because at the end of the day i New York people are waiting until they receive the shot in regards to social distancing and the air at hand.I feel like New York has a lot of cases because the air pollution helped the corona virus to speed more.

5,Sarah Cruz AOSE,Academy of Saint Elizabeth,"I noticed that all the states are categorized through circles with different shapes and colors within them. The colors represent the level of concern. The shapes within the circles display different barriers within the states that limit corona virus vaccinations from happening. I also noticed that most of the southern states have larger limitations.
I wonder how the restrictions in these areas can be resolved. I also wonder how the number of cases may affect whether or not people want to get vaccinations. If a state has higher number of cases like NY, do they have more vaccinations available? If so is that why there's a lower level of concern on the map for vaccination barriers?
This impacts my community because living in the East coast it seems like most of the states have a low level of concern when it comes to vaccination barriers. Hopefully this means that our communities are able to have immunity because of it soon.
A headline for this graph could be ""Vaccination Barriers Around the States""",FALSE
5,Lola Stephens,Washington,"I notice that the lower central states have the highest level of concern.
I wonder why Hawaii has a low level of concern, because it is farther away from the contiguous states, and vaccines might be harder to transport there.
The impact this has on me and my community is that it shows us how we can change to get vaccinated quicker, and maybe why our state isn't getting vaccinated as quickly.

5,Malaya,Detroit,"I noticed that the barriers are very different due to the act of the population. I also noticed all the different shapes and colors that the states are. It is very interesting that the different shapes symbolize the different problems with the coronavirus. I can see that the different colors represent a high level of concern. 
I notice that Southern states have low health care resources and that there are 8 states that have very high risk. 
The east coast has good health care services and is low risk for concern.
The pinker states have a higher level of concern and the green-colored states have the least amount of concern. I wonder if this concern is coming from a lack of resources? Or if the states have a lot more cases that are very confusing to understand and control? I also was wondering if Southern states are more at high risk than other states?

5,Joshua Lopez,New York,"I noticed that the barriers are very different state by state due to the act of population. Due to this it varied from state to state and then now i think that with the vaccine and the borders changed and opened up which is a positive.

5,Megan McDermott,New York,"I noticed that the states with fewer barriers outnumber the states with more barriers, which is positive.

I am grateful that this does not have much of an effect on my family because we live in New York where the concern level is low. A catchphrase could be ""Barriers that we need to take down"".",FALSE
5,Leema C,Valley Stream,"The first thing that I noticed was the juxtaposed sizes between Southern and Northern states. As you pan down, you will notice the color change and size enlargement per each state. Another notable detail is that each state is in its respective shape; however, blown out of scale based on the states' healthcare circumstances. For example, a state swayed to the left represents its irregular medical care, but the sharper right implies socioeconomic barriers, etc. As for the color change, the graph notes that a pinkish color represents a higher amount of vaccination barriers.

Fortunately, I live in a Northern state. Therefore, significant vaccination barriers do not affect my community in comparison to any Southern state.  The graph does mark the great socioeconomic barrier within our healthcare system. However, the community I live in tends to represent slightly higher incomes,  given it is just right outside the city. 

Lastly, from my understanding, the graph represents vaccination restrictions and the suppression within a state's medical system. Additionally, from examining the graph, you would notice drastic changes from Northern vs. Southern states. Specifically, it shows that Southern states most likely seek large amounts of poor health care access and low health care resources. Regarding a title for the graph, I would suggest ""Your States' Noted COVID-19 Vaccination Barriers.""",FALSE

I wonder if this concern is coming from a lack of resources? I wonder if the other states have a lot more cases that are hard to control? This affects my community and me as I am in one of the states that are not that concerned and it shows us that we are lucky to be where we are.

5,Vincent B.,Valley Stream North High School,"Three things noticed/wondered:
Firstly, I noticed that most Southern states and some Western states have the most challenging and prevalent obstacles to overcome and the North, especially the Northeast, have the least obstacles for getting the vaccine. Second, I noticed that so many states have a history of prevalent undervaccination. In fact, there were many more states with this history than I thought or knew of. Finally, I wonder what kind of socioeconomic barriers people face within these states.

Impact on me and my community:
The impact this graph had on me was that it helped me realize that there are many more socioeconomic barriers in my community than I realized and I will work to research these to inform myself and my community.

Wonderings: I wonder why states down south or in the mid west are at a higher risk than states up north? I also wonder if the reason why the higher risk states or at a concerning risk is because of  money, funding or population? I also wonder if this will lead to an ending to COVID or not? 

Connection: In connection to my home state NY, I agree that on that scale we are low risk or less concerned because of all the safety majors our govern and my cities mayor took since the. beginning of the pandemic.

5,Ethan Ramos,Valley Stream North High School,"The graph presents several thought provoking points. I noticed that many of the states in the northeast had a lower level of vaccine barriers compared to others states. I noticed that states in the south and south west had higher vaccine barriers which was a vast contrast to north eastern states. This made me wonder about the public sentiment on vaccines and the vaccine history of these states.

Since I currently live in New York, my concern for receiving the vaccine in a reasonable amount of time is low. My state seem to have a lesser amount of concern which is reassuring. 

A title which could apply to this graph is ""The key barriers that are preventing individuals getting a vaccine"". The title is applicable to the graph because it focuses on five major issues holding back states in vaccinating their citizens.",FALSE
5,"Brooke, Elle, Rose, Sarah","Eden Prairie, MN","The Next Obstacle For Coronavirus: Vaccine Distribution

After examining this graph we noticed a couple of things such as the Southern states face significantly more barriers to vaccination than the rest of the country, due to lack of or poor health care. Also, Indiana faces the most barriers of all the midwestern states. Another thing we noticed was that Virginia and Colorado have the best health care out of all the states. Smaller states like Massachusetts have easier access to the vaccine and face fewer barriers to rapid vaccination. Lastly, we noticed that several states have good performance in all of the categories except for low health care resources. We have some questions about the graph like why the southern states that lifted their mask mandate have more trouble getting access to the vaccine. We wonder why states in the midwest and east coast have fewer barriers to vaccination unlike the states in the south. We wonder if factors such as population affect certain states from getting more access to the vaccine. This graph impacts our community because it shows how good the state??s health care systems are and if they are able to distribute the vaccine properly, however since we live in Minnesota, according to the graph we have a great health care system and good access to it. This does not mean it is perfect though, which means there are still people struggling to get the vaccine and find good health care.",FALSE
5,Group 1(EROH),Eden Prairie High School,"This graph divides the United States of America into fifty states into bubbles, each bubble has five data points that ultimately represent the risk levels of Covid-19 and any resistance to the use of vaccine within each state. The group noticed a few things about this graph, for one we noticed that the more vaccine-hesitant and higher risk areas were generally clustered in the southern states. In contrast, the east, especially Mssacushets and Connecticut, have the lowest risks of Covid-19 and the most vaccine usage across the country. Our group still remains curious about the accuracy of this graph. We wonder how all this data was collected and about the reliability of the results. We believe that this graph impacts the spread and containment of the coronavirus. Which affects our path back to normality. It appears to affect me and my community because the health care resources are very low in Minnesota and that's where we all live.",FALSE
5,"Grace U, Kaitlin B, Evan D, Brian S","Eden Prairie, MN","Kaitlin Bryhn, Grace Urban, Evan Divine, and Brian Samuel

The data presented in these graphs led to severing findings that our group noticed. The first thing we found was that the East coast has relatively low concern levels for vaccination barriers. However, New York, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island share similar concerns for social economic barriers. We also noticed that there are more vaccination barriers in the Southern states. Our own state of Minnesota has a relatively low level of concern. We also wondered why there is such a great divide between the North and the South in vaccination barriers? Could this be a result of certain regions being prioritized for vaccination over other states and what impact does that have on vaccination barriers? Access to vaccinations plays a major role in ensuring that the entire community can be healthy and safe amidst this pandemic. In Minnesota, vaccination access is much better than many other states, although the greatest barrier is low health care resources. Depending on which state you live in, this will affect the role the government plays in mandating policies to curb the spread and distribute vaccinations. Lastly, if your state has a low level of concern, restrictions might be limited and the community might open up sooner. We would title this article, ??America??s grasp on vaccines: Vaccination barriers and their fingerprints.??",FALSE
5,"Lily Baker,AOSE",Academy of Saint Elizabeth.,"In looking at this graph, it is obvious that the states located on the southern part of the US have more vaccination barriers than the northern part of the US. I also notice that the western part of the United also has more coronavirus vaccination barriers as well. I wonder why the northeast and northwest of the US have the least amount of vaccination barriers. I also wonder why poor health care access will limit the amount of vaccines given as vaccine doses purchased with taxpayer dollars are free, there could just be an administering fee. If we are trying to create a herd immunity, shouldn't places that are low income be offered free vaccines if the actual dosage is free to the person administering it? This does not directly impact my community but impacts my country because New Jersey has  very low barriers on vaccinations. 
New Headline: ""Who Is Getting the Vaccine, Take a Look""",FALSE
5,"Emma T, Ian B, and Karah S",Eden Prairie High School,"We notice that the states in the south have higher amounts of roadblocks to getting the coronavirus vaccine. We also noticed that the most common barrier to getting the vaccine is historic undervaccination and irregular health care. The states with low barriers to get the vaccine also lean more toward the democratic side of politics. We wonder why there is a difference in the middle of the north and southern states. We wonder if the barriers perhaps mean that the vaccines only happen within the barrier. We also wonder if the population affects what will happen with the vaccinations and barriers in each state, especially in Virginia. The Impact that will be seen through this data is that the states with the lowest level of healthcare barriers will be the first states to reopen safely. Another impact seen will be overall access to healthcare in the coming years. States in the south may struggle to provide quality healthcare due to an overwhelming amount of covid treatment. Where states in the north will be able to focus on providing healthcare to non Covid cases southern states will still be handling Covid patients and ignoring other medical crises.

5,Lauren Iskander,AOSE,"I notice that the overall level of concern is much higher in the Southern states such as Florida, Texas, Georgia, and Mississippi. Contrastingly, there is a lower level concern in Northern states such as Washington, North Dakota, Minnesota, and New Hampshire. I also notice that the states in the Northeast have significantly less coronavirus vaccination barriers than the rest of the United States.  

I wonder why the overall level of concern is higher in southern states. Is it because of the main political ideology in those states? Is it because of the warmer weather motivating people to leave their homes more often? 

Since I live in a community that is not plagued by many coronavirus vaccine barriers, it is likely that the data in this graph will offer comfort to many in my community. I have already noticed how many people are receiving vaccines in my area due to the lack of limitations people in my state face.

5,Sara Warren,"Eden Prairie, MN","We noticed that the Northeast has the least amount of barriers to coronavirus vaccinations, while the Southern United States has the most barriers to vaccination. Many states that otherwise have low barriers to vaccination have a high barrier in the category for ??low healthcare resources?? since they likely can??t cater to a lot of people in need of a vaccine. We wonder if the data on this graph will end up affecting us negatively? Why are North Dakota and South Dakota so different even though they are very similar and close to each other? This impacts our community greatly because we are currently working to minimize the arrears for community members to get the vaccine.

I live in NJ with low levels of vaccination barriers, however, I know many people in my state, especially those who are not great at technology, are having a hard time getting vaccines.

I notice that many of the southern states have large areas of concern. I also notice that most states have some level of concern and it is interesting how it varies from state to state. For example, New York is having more problems socioeconomically while Vermont has more issues which historic under vaccination. 

What do you wonder?
I wonder why the states that have opened up more have more problems with getting the vaccine. 

What impact does this have on you and your community?
I live in Massachusetts and there are no large concerns/barriers however, the rollout and availability of the vaccine is slow. New Hampshire has opened up to a vast majority of residents, however, Massachusetts is much slower. This could be because of a multitude of differences from population to New Hampshire being under-vaccinated, thus having more vaccines for people who want to receive it.

5,Bidipta Roy,Valley Stream North,"I noticed in the graph that the southern states have significantly more barriers to vaccination than the northeastern states. According to the key, the southern states don't have much concern with Historic under vaccination, but rather the other 4 reasons as shown in the Alaska key. I wonder why the southern states have more barriers, but as far as I know, there is no clear answer to this and begs the question of what types of barriers or laws could the southern states posses that would be an obstacle to widespread vaccination.

There is a low level of concern in my community and state of New York. However, according to the graph, possible barriers in NYC could of socioeconomic concern. Personally, I have not seen any obstacles so far, as both my parents have been vaccinated already without any hassle.

""What's going on in these graphs?""-- The graph shows a map of the 50 states with their various types of coronavirus vaccination barriers and their degree of concern. An appropriate, yet catchy title that depicts the main idea of this graph would be ""How concerning are these vaccination barriers in the United States"" or ""What are these sacrilegious vaccination barriers in my state"" or, ""How can fingerprints accurately depict vaccination barriers?"" It truly makes no sense as to why the US is so unequal when it comes to vaccine distribution in a serious pandemic. In my opinion, any legislations that inhibit the proper and effective distribution of vaccines, should be toned down.",FALSE
5,Ian Rios,"Long Island, New York","When looking at the graph, two things are immediately evident. The first of these being, states in the northeastern area of the US have a low level of concern regarding the virus in comparison to those states in the south. The graph shows this using color codes that show a low level of concern being green, a high level of concern being magenta, and anything thing in between being blue, purple, or turquoise. The second thing I noticed was the fact that most northeastern states do not have many barriers preventing vaccination in comparison to the south. With these two observations in mind, I wonder what sectional factors are contributing to this rather drastic difference in vaccine concern and vaccination barriers.

Seeing the information associated with New York, this being that NY is a blue state with few vaccination barriers is very reassuring to me and my community as it means we likely on the right track in terms of our practices to prevent the spread of COVID-19. However, it cannot be denied that there is room for improvement in our practices.

The graph clearly depicts the obstacles each state faces in regards to vaccinations. A title that could work here is ""What could be holding your state back from rapid vaccination?"". This title manages to summarize what the focus of the graph is, this being the obstacles some states will face that will keep them from being rapidly vaccinated.",FALSE
5,Afia Kapadwala,Valley Stream North High School,"While viewing this graph, I noticed how there is a key in the upper right corner that allows the audience to see that purple states depicted on the map have a high concern for coronavirus vaccination barriers while green states have a lower concern. I also noticed how the state of Alaska is surrounded by five factors that may contribute to the high level of concern that this state poses in relation to coronavirus vaccination barriers. It seems that Alaska serves as a key to represent the potential factors that may be restricting vaccination in other states, depending upon which angle the color of the state is shaded in, since each angle points toward a different factor. I wonder why northeastern  states depicted on the map seem to have lower concern than southern and western states. 

The graph illustrates that the state I live in (New York) has a low concern for vaccination barriers. Indeed, I have also seen others in my community, such as teachers and health care professionals, go to get vaccinated rather frequently. This supports the idea that New York has a low concern about vaccination barriers.

The graph depicts the various factors that may contribute to vaccination barriers in each state. As such, a relevant title for this graph may be ""What Barriers are Restricting Rapid Vaccination in Your State?"" because it is both eye-catching and it reveals the purpose of the graph to the reader without them having to try to understand what information is being presented.",FALSE

*You will not get full credit unless you address all three bullet
It is clearly depicted in the graph that the northeastern states such as New York and New Jersey pose less of a risk for having barriers when receiving the covid 19 vaccine compared to southern states. This was clearly shown as the states are laid out in proper geographical location. With the key telling the reader that blue/green states are less of a concern with regards to vaccination. I wonder what legislation was put in place in the southern states that it is making it harder for people to get vaccines.

The graph has minimal impact on my community as I am from New York. The graph actually shows a positive outlook for the state because vaccines are easier to access in the state. While there have been some difficult hurdles when actually booking an appointment for your vaccine, this is definitely a step in the right direction because it puts us a little closer to getting back to ""normal.""

The graph is showing the state breakdown on the ease of receiving a vaccine. An appropriate title would be ""State regulations are confusing- Who can get the vaccine?"" The wide restrictions and regulations can be frustrating for Americans who want the vaccine. The system needs improving, but our vaccine rollout is a step in the right direction.",FALSE
5,Samantha Szabo,Valley Stream North High School,"By viewing the graph, I noticed that the northern and northeastern states tend to have less vaccination barriers when compared to the southern states. Furthermore, I notice that the northeast has more more blue and green states as opposed to the majority of the south which has more purple. The colors represent the overall level of concern, thus it would be appropriate to conclude that the northeastern states have less concerns than southern states. With this in mind, I wonder what specific factors contribute to this sectional difference between northern and southern states. Is there anything the north does that the south should follow in order to be safer and with less concern?

Since I live in New York, a blue state in the Northeast with relatively minimal barriers, the graph has a reassuring impact on myself and my community because it displays that our practices have been successful to a certain degree and that we have less overall level of concern. There is definitely room for improvement, but this shows we are moving in the right direction.

The graph depicts the various barriers states face regarding vaccinations. An appropriate title could be ""What is stopping your state from getting vaccinated?"". The barriers include historic under vaccination, irregular medical care, poor health care access, low health care resources, and socioeconomic barriers. The states each have their own individual situations that directly inhibit the population's ability to be vaccinated.",FALSE
5,Madelyn Dusel,Valley Stream North High School,"When looking at this graph I noticed that the graph is arranged in the shape of the United States so that I can easily recognize what state I am looking at. I noticed that the Southern states have many more vaccination barriers than the Northern states. I noticed that the Southern states share many of the vaccination barriers. I wonder why so many of the states have such restrictions with the vaccination while others do not. 
The information in the chart does not exactly impact me or my community. I live in New York where the majority of our barriers are socioeconomic barriers. My community is not a very low-income one so I do not believe that we are affected by this very much. I do recognize that I am lucky to live in such a good community and to be in a state that does not have as many vaccine restrictions as others.
The graph is showing the various different major coronavirus barriers across the United States. These barriers include historic under vaccination, irregular medical care, poor health care access, low health care resources, and socioeconomic barriers. I think that a good title for this graph could be ""Vaccination Restrictions across the US"".",FALSE
5,Aadil Alli,New York,"In the graph I noticed that North-Eastern states such as New Jersey, Connecticut, and Massachusetts are among the states with the lowest concerns of healthcare issues in the United States; however, the middle, southern, and western states tend to be at higher concern in regards to health care issues. 

I wonder why the middle, southern, and western states have higher health care concerns. I believe that one major challenge for these states is the land. Most of the states with extremely high concern are highly rural areas where there might not be access to a multitude of healthcare options seen in cities like New York. 

This does not have a major impact on me and my community as I live in New York; however, this graph can be extremely helpful as it describes what an individual state needs to work on in terms of their healthcare practices in order to better the state and its people. It is also reassuring knowing that my state is not at a disadvantage with multiple highly concerning barriers that we should be worried about. 

In this graph it describes the overall levels of concern regarding individual states and different challenges people face with healthcare. With the green representing a low concern (positive) and the pinkish-purple representing a high concern (negative) you are able to figure out which states experience the most difficulty with healthcare for their residents. I would name this graph ??The obstacles in front of effective healthcare.??",FALSE
5,Eva G. Martinez,Valley Stream LI (VSN),"Looking at this graph, I see a direct correlation between areas with significant funding in education, and high rates of vaccine equity (CA's anti-vax population being the exception). 
I also see that irregular medical care appears to be the most common issue across the county. I also notice that the northeast seems to have significantly fewer barriers to vaccination. 
As a resident of a county within the northeast united states, my community is impacted in a different way than many others. Although my community will not be directly impacted by lack of vaccinations, travel as well as medical tourism may bring new covid cases into my area. 
This graph displays information regarding  vaccination barriers within each state, therefore I think a catchy title may be: ""Vying for Vaccinations: Victories and Values in Vaccine Distribution.""",FALSE
5,Lauren Creger,"Cedar Falls, Iowa","Looking at the graph, I notice that slightly shaded circles represent each state and the color part that is shaded in each of the circles represent level of concern across each state. 
Some things that I wonder from looking at the graph is why is there such a difference between northern states and southern states? With that idea, how do ""we"" decide where vaccine are being located and who gets to take them? Why is it different for each state? 
I live in Iowa and as this information may not directly impact me as Iowa has a low level of concern with vaccine barriers. This information may still impact my community because Iowa has a moderate to high concern for socioeconomic barriers where this may directly impact certain communities. 
This graph shows us the vaccination barriers that each state has. While none of the states are the same, this is something to think about because we get to look into the different barriers that each state encounters as to why some areas or people may be limited to receiving the vaccine.",FALSE
5,William Mullin,"Long Island, New York","I noticed that the graphs of the states are arranged in the obvious shape of the United States. This makes it so that viewing and comparing the states is easy and logical. I noticed that the smaller states and states in the northeast had fewer vaccination barriers than states in the south and larger states. Also, according to this graph, a majority of southern states have a lot of vaccination barriers. I wonder why there is such a disparity between the southern states and the northeastern states. States in the midwest also have some vaccination barriers, but they are not nearly as prominent as states in the south. 
         This information doesn't directly impact my community and me, but it shows how fortunate we are. A majority of the vaccination barrier for New York comes from socioeconomic barriers. This is quite unfortunate; however, this does not necessarily affect me, and I'm assuming it doesn't affect my community much since my community is relatively not of low-income. Though, I'm sure there are exceptions. With that being said, it showed me how grateful my state is to have so few vaccination barriers.
       This graph clearly shows the vaccination barriers each state encounters, whether it be historic under vaccination, irregular medical care, poor health care access, low health care resources, or socioeconomic barriers.

5,Genesis,Pennsylvania,"The graphs has all been placed to create the shape of the U.S and the graph of the state is where the state should be. I also noticed how the north eastern side of the U.S has a low concern level as well as Hawaii. However, the southern part has higher concerns in comparison to some northern states. I wonder why there seems to be a difference in between the north and southern states. Another wondering is how does the population of who was tested positive compare to the concern level of the state. Like does a state with high concern have a higher level of people who tested positive or what is the difference of who tested positive from each state. 
I won't be as impacted as some other states because I live where the state and surrounding states have low concern levels. However, the socioeconomic barrier is high for my state, so I'm concerned on how the vaccine would be distributed to everyone.

5,Katelynn Persaud,Valley Stream North High School,"The first thing I noticed was that states in the South have a lot more barriers than other regions of the country. I also took note of the fact that states in the northeast seem to have fewer barriers as opposed to other parts. I wonder why Virginia is the only Southern state to not have many barriers.

I live in New York which is one of the states with comparatively less barriers. Therefore, there are not as many concerns for me and my community when taking into account the Southern states. It should be noted that New York has to address socioeconomic barriers.  

I think ""What's Holding Your State Back From Rapid Vaccination?"" is an appropriate title. It sums up that graph is outlining certain problems that are hampering states' success in rapid vaccination.

2) I notice that Virginia and Colorado have better health care than the other states, but also that there are less barriers around Virginia compared to the other states.
3)I wonder why if population can play a factor in barriers being placed throughout a certain state.

It hasn't impacted me or my community if I'm being perfectly honest, the vaccine has been a driving issue based on its numerous attempts and despite it's success rate many people are willing to take the risk just to feel safe. I hope that once quarantine and COVID-19 is able to be contained we will be able to live our daily lives in peace without the risk of disease or having to wear masks in public.

In this graph it seems to show us what each state is facing as they attempt to retrieve the vaccine, showing examples like Low health care resources and Irregular medical care playing roles in why it is becoming increasingly difficult to receive these kinds of items.

5,Tiffany Wong,Valley Stream North High School,"The first thing I have noticed is the different colors on the map ranging from blue being the lowest level of concern while purple-pink being the highest concern. Another observation I noticed is Connecticut and Massachusetts have the smallest vaccination barriers. The last thing I notice is the North-East has very few vaccination barriers compared to the rest of the United States. 

I am from New York so it does not have that many limitations except socioeconomic barriers. I believe this would impact when I can get the vaccine along with the rest of the community. Compared to the rest of the country, I would not be impacted that badly compared to the Southern States who has many barriers in receiving the vaccine.

My headline would be what makes it so difficult to receive a vaccine? This graph shows the barriers and obstacles when it comes to receiving a vaccine and the concern that it raises.",FALSE
5,Daniel Amin,Valley Stream North High School,"The first thing that I noticed when looking at this graph was that how drastic the difference in barriers was based on the region. It is clear to see that the region with the greatest amount of barriers is the South and that the region with the least barriers is the Northeast. Based off of these observations, I wonder why the South is in such a worse circumstance in comparison to the rest of the United States. I an also curious as to why Virginia is the only state in the South that does not seem to have an abnormally large amount of barriers before getting the vaccine.

These restrictions have a fairly major impact on my community. Although I live in New York, which is one of the states with fewer barriers, the issue of getting the vaccine is still very prevalent. These barriers are delaying the vaccines from being distributed which is a very bad thing. Not only does it put more people at risk, but it also prevents the communities from opening back up fully. If these vaccines can be properly distributed, hopefully there will be more leniency with all the strict rules that there are right now due to Covid. For example, maybe schools and sports can go back to being more normal again.

A headline that I would use for this graph is: What Barrier Will You Face For Vaccination. The graph shows the obstacles each state has to face when trying to get the vaccine. Using this information each person can deduce what barrier they will most likely have to face.",FALSE
5,Sophia Mura,Valley Stream North,"What I notice and wonder:
 - It seems many states in the south have higher concerns on the vaccines than northern states (usually on the east coast)
 - I notice many states with vaccination concerns have been historically under-vaccinated in the past 
 - I wonder why most conservative states are the ones who have high vaccination concerns while most liberal states have less 

This has a large impact on the rate at which the coronavirus will linger in America. If we have a lot of states having high concerns about the vaccination, they probably will opt not to receive it. this slows down the rate of herd immunity in America and will prolong the coronavirus pandemic. If you are born in Nevada for example, who has high concerns over the vaccine, you may have a worse outbreak of coronavirus and harsher policies for safety in comparison to New Hampshire, who has achieved herd immunity and has slightly more freedom.

Since to me at least, if we can all social distance then we can all keep ourselves safe until the vaccine is distributed to everyone.",TRUE
6,Anonymus,Hong Kong,"What do you notice?
I notice that there is a larger amount of frontline workers than I previously imagined. Specifically I noticed that the medical sector (despite its critical importance) is only a small part of the frontline workers. I also notice that most of the educational sector belongs to the essential occupations.

What do you wonder?
Knowing logically the vaccine will be distributed to frontline workers first it makes me wonder if certain frontline sectors are as important. For example, are fast food workers more important in the factor of getting vaccinated than educational workers? Even Though students and teachers can go to school remotely shouldn't it also be an important factor to work in person physically than chefs for example 

What impact does this have on you and your community?
I think this graph shows significantly as well how the virus is able to spread. In terms of how easily if measures are not met at specific places ,like fast food chains, the virus is more likely to spread. It also impacts how I perceive occupational importance in my community. Used to thinking that medical professions are more crucial yet the food and production industries are just as crucial.",FALSE
6,Shelby C.,Washington,"The graph helps to separate the jobs that are considered essential and frontline workers with colors and shows how each  main job can be considered essential or frontline if broken down further. The main essentials would be education, office support and agriculture. The mains for frontlines are health care, transportation and food services. The services that require more interaction with people are considered frontline which were more then I expected compared to essential. I do wonder what the standard for a frontline worker and essential worker would be? What checks on a list must be made to put these jobs into the categories that they are in. The graph would affect me as I would guess I would fall into cashier or somewhere around there as I do work in a grocery store. I would title this Frontline vs. Essential, which jobs have people get the vaccine first?",TRUE
6,Sofia C,US,"What do you notice? I notice that they are more frontline workers than essential workers. Seeing the graph gives me the thought that the frontline workers will get vaccinated first.

What do you wonder? In the education area, I wonder why the 1.4 million elementary school teachers and 1 million secondary school teachers, and including other teachers aren??t considered frontline. When teachers go to school wearing their mask and teaching, and need to be cautious or go into quarantine if someone in their school building test positive for COVID. But then again, some teachers can teach from home but then also they would need to be present physically at school for the students who are going in person.

What impact does this have on you and your community? It impacts me to view this graph to understand why, on who should get vaccinated first. For my community, if some of us do or do not get vaccinated first, it should always be a number one priority to keep each other safe to wear the right masks and to socially distance.

What??s going on in this graph?  In the graph it shows how many frontline and essential workers there are and who will most likely get the vaccine first. Catchy headline: Are frontline workers more at risk than essential workers?",TRUE

6,Gio Coppola,"Andover, MA","I notice that about half of the industries shown are considered front line jobs. All educators (minus special ed and post secondary chemistry teachers) are not considered to be on the front lines, which doesn't make any sense but okay. 33,470 people work as ""funerary attendants"", which is a lot more people than I expected to have that job. There are also a lot more RNs than physicians and I just think that's interesting. I wonder what the exact standards are for ""front line"" jobs? I work at an ice cream place, so I think that may fall under the cashier category, in which case myself and all of my coworkers will be able to get the vaccine earier than most people. I would title this ""Who Will be Getting the Vaccine First?""",TRUE
6,Kaitlin,Massachusetts,"I notice that the graph separates frontline workers from essential workers and also groups occupations by field. There are more frontline workers than essential workers. Areas such as healthcare, food preparation and serving, and transportation have the largest amounts of frontline workers. Meanwhile, education and office and administrative support have the largest amount of essential workers. 

I wonder what specifically qualifies an occupation as essential or frontline. I also wonder if these terms are popularized due to the pandemic and other natural disasters. I also wonder what the infection rate and mortality rate is for each occupation and whether this affects vaccine priority and accessibility.  

This impacts me because I know people who are frontline workers and essential workers. With limited supply and increasing infection rate, the prioritization of who receives the vaccine is important. While frontline workers have greater exposure and are more likely to catch COVID, cases spread quickly among the general population. Public places, like schools, that are open are also vulnerable, and therefore those with educational jobs can be as susceptible as frontline workers. COVID has affected many families, especially those with members who are essential and frontline workers. Hopefully, with the distribution of vaccines right now, both spread and deaths will be reduced.

6,Cleo,AOSE,"What do you notice? The industries with the most frontier and essential workers are office and administrative support, health care, Transportation, and Food preparation and serving. Jobs with the highest amount of workers are usually service works where the workers have to physically interact with people. These jobs include nurses, office clerks, customer service representatives, cashiers, counter workers, chefs,... With the support of technologies, media, and entertainment industries are able to operate without many frontlines and essential workers. The number of people going to work physically and risking their lives every day is huge, making vaccination more important than ever.

What do you wonder? Being a part of the food industry, which is always in high demand, how are farming, fishing, and forestry number so low?

This impacts everyone in the world. Especially students right now who have to do remote instead of in person school. If Frontline workers got the vaccine first it would probably take a longer time for essential workers aka teachers to get the vaccine. Which would lead to online school being longer.

Within each occupation's circle there are more specific jobs and the number of people within those jobs can be viewed through text on the circles or by clicking on them. The graph also shows that there are more frontline workers than essential workers.  

I wonder how essential workers and frontline workers are differentiated. Were these titles really distinguished only after the pandemic? How are special education and chemistry teachers frontline while the rest are essential?

This impacts my society because I have family members that are considered essential workers and their careers are shown in this graph. The point of this graph is to show how many there are in each essential and frontline occupation, to determine whether they should get the vaccines first or not. In my opinion, frontline or essential, many of these jobs deem very important to our society and those who want the vaccine who work for either category should be able to get it.

I wonder what the debate is about on who should receive the vaccine first, it is very obvious that the frontline would need it first. They are in the trenches treating and caring for the patients.  They are caregivers, they do not have the option to stay in the safety of their homes, they are out in the eye of the storm.

The impact in my community is grand.  We can not live life like we are accustomed to. Our social lives are non-existent, church events are very strained, students are having to learn differently. People are losing their jobs, losing family members to this illness, people are having to sacrifice living to live.

I notice that the occupation groups with the most frontline workers are the following: Health care, Transportation, and Food preparation and serving. The occupation groups with the largest amounts of essential workers are the following: Education, and Office and administrative support. I also notice that the graph depicts several types of jobs within each overall category. There are thousands of workers contained within even the smallest circles. Finally, it appears that there are more frontline workers than essential workers. 

What do you wonder?
I wonder what constitutes a frontline worker and what constitutes an essential worker. Why is it that machinists are considered frontline workers and not elementary school teachers?

What impact does this have on you and your community?
I personally know at least one person who works in almost every single one of the categories depicted in the graph. Many of the people I know who work within occupations deemed ""frontline"" have received vaccines or are planning to receive vaccines in the near future. Essential and frontline workers exist in every community (especially my own) and they are the first individuals receiving vaccines. Hopefully rates of infection within my community will decrease as a result.

Why are these healthcare workers not considered frontline workers and only essential workers? This has an effect on my community and me as we can now see which jobs are considered to be frontline and essential works.

With high numbers of frontline workers, vaccinations are more likely to take a longer time in logistics. It is self-explanatory that healthcare workers, in all probability,  be vaccinated before anyone. Consequentially, with many frontline and essential workers, these vaccines' transportation can be an extremely troublesome issue. Mass rollout of these vaccines may take more than months to get workers vaccinated or get half of them vaccinated. The production of vaccines is moving at a slow pace. *With last month??s increased number of covid cases, workers with essential and frontline occupations should be vaccinated as quickly as possible.

I wonder which industries will receive the vaccines the quickest. I already know the health care workers will get priority and I assume other frontline workers would be next, but which essential industries would be next in line to receive vaccinations? Will it go in order of the size of the industries or will be there be different means of determining priority? 

This impacts me and my community because the graph shows that almost any occupation is somehow affected by the coronavirus and that so many of my friends and peers parents are in dire need of the vaccine to be able to work at all. I am lucky my dad can work from home and my mom is a teacher who is following a hybrid schedule like me, but many other workers are not so lucky. One of my closest friends recently got Covid-19 because her dad is an essential worker who knew he was being exposed at work, but he still had to go in anyway. Lots of families are in similar situations, where either the parents have no choice but to expose themselves, or became unemployed. Hopefully the vaccines are available to all these industries as soon as possible to stop the spread.

When people think transportation they usually think of delivery drivers such as those who work for UPS, USPS, and Prime who deliver packages to your door. However, the number of frontline workers representing the transportation industry is far greater than just those types of delivery drivers. 

I wonder how the order of vaccinations are going to work and what type of workers are considered essential for getting them. I personally think health care workers who work directly with sick patients should get the vaccine first. Then the rest of the healthcare industry. Then I think elderly and people with preexisting conditions who work in frontline occupations should get the vaccine after healthcare workers.

The production of the vaccines are moving slow and this impacts my community because many of my family friends work in frontline occupations. They are scared they are going to get sick and are waiting patiently for the vaccine. This also impacts me as a student and fellow students because I know some larger public schools haven't been able to open this year and hopefully with a vaccine schools will be able to open full time and students doing remote can go back.

This graph shows who is essential and whos frontline, and I'm quite surprised with who is considered frontline and essential workers.
""Who should get the vaccine first and why""",TRUE
6,Victoria Nock,Asheville,"1. I noticed that there are many essential jobs and most can't be done from home. Health care, transportation, construction and extraction, and food preparation and serving are all frontlines that make them our priority for getting to the vaccine.
2. I wonder how well did the frontline workers do as opposed to the essential workers.
3. My community needs to know how this vaccine will be handled, whether it's who gets it first or who deserves it more.
4. A catchy title would be ""essential workers vs. frontline workers, who should be our priority.""",TRUE
6,Ericka,WA,"I noticed that the essential workers that can work from home and the front line workers are both in different categories.

I wonder why most of education is grey when there are some states that are having in person schools.

This impacts my community because teachers are not considered frontline, so it's going to be even longer for when we can go back to school.

6,Katie,Washington,"What do you notice?
There are a lot more bubbles in here than I thought. There is a lot of essential and frontline workers I never thought of before like boat drivers or morticians, but I can see why they are essential.

What do you wonder?
About the  postsecondary chemistry teachers being considered frontline. I know they have to do their labs in person unlike how some can do simulations but I figured others would have to do labs in person like biology professors.

What Impact does this have on you or your community?
Whoever is considered the most important for vaccination could affect the local economy. A lot of people I know who normally work in person have to work at home or are working reduced hours or no hours at all.

6,Oona,USA,"The main thing I noticed in regards to the content of this infographic is that sports, entertainment and media are considered ??essential??, media is essential for the lifestyle that Americans live, it is not however essential for livelihood. Additionally, I noticed that politicians are not included on the graph at all. I wonder how accurate and representative the information in this graph is, does it include undocumented people? The differentiation between frontline and essential will impact my community in who receives the vaccine faster. I think a more appropriate title to this article would be ??Rounding the Curve, who will get Vaccinated First???.",FALSE

6,Maddie,Washington,"What did you notice? 
-  I noticed there are more people at risk of contracting Covid and working on the front than I initially thought. I already had an idea about the number of healthcare workers, but what surprised me was the food preparation and serving group and funerary services. I didn't realize how essential they are, or how numerous.

What did you wonder?
-  How was this data obtained and how accurate is it? Are these statistics based only in the US or does it branch out to other countries?

What impact does this have on you and your community?
-  I think of this data as a web. For every one frontline worker, there are dozens of friends or family members they come in contact with. The more frontline workers, the greater the risk of contracting covid. The sooner the vaccine can be mass distributed, the better off we will be.

I noticed that the orange areas of the graph are frontline workers, jobs that can't be done at home, and that there are more than essential workers, gray areas. 

What do you wonder?

I didn't realize that there were so many different kinds of frontline workers, but I do wonder why there are some labeled as essential workers, such as biological science teachers whereas chemistry teachers are labeled as frontline. 

What impact does this have on you and your community?

I don't think that it has much of an impact, it just sets out who is considered a frontline worker and whose job could be done at home. It does make me wonder who in my community would be first in line (after healthcare workers) to be vaccinated and what determines that.

6,Aidan,Whidbey Island,"What do you notice?

What do you wonder?
Why are chemistry teachers among the only frontline teachers, while there are other like career/ technical educators secondary school. 
What impact does this have on you and your community?
The fact that teachers aren't generally considered frontline workers means they might get the vaccine later, and thus delay school further.

6,Sammi Daly,Whidbey Island,"What do you notice?
- Under the education bubbles most are grey meaning they're essential not frontline (most schools are online but there are frontline teachers at some schools - someone in my group pointed out that it may be that grey gives you the option to do work online)

What do you wonder?
- Where are the doctors? I only see nurses and assistants. (After discussions the doctors are split into their more specific occupation) 
- If fast food workers and doctors/nurses are both frontline, what does that mean for the vaccination?

What impact does this have on you and your community?
- Within the community we have essential workers. Under these categories, I would have been considered essential if the restaurant I work at wouldn't have closed.

6,Sadie,Washington,"Upon first glance, I notice that there are about the same number of essential bubbles as frontline bubbles. Now there appear to be more frontline bubbles that have a large population, so in terms of people, there are more frontline workers. I also noticed that there are a lot of specific professions that have been declared frontline positions, that I personally wouldn't view them as essential frontline workers. However, I also have to take into account my location and the intensity of the pandemic, as well as how strict we are about our COVID restrictions. 

Going a little off of my last thought, I can't help but wonder if these numbers could be significantly reduced if all the states were to abide by the same structured COVID regulations. It would also be interesting to see a similarly formatted graph of a different country that has strict quarantine rules and few COVID cases. 

I live in a small community, so this graph would likely have little to no impact on me or my community. It is however, interesting to learn more about. 

""How political conscience will decide your future""",TRUE
6,Raven,Washington,"What do you notice?
-There is a lot of front-line and essential bubbles that are confusing and don't make sense from my point of view. It's weird to think that ""entertainment, sports media"" is essential. There also are more frontline circles than essential workers.

-I'm wondering why there's not a ""both"" section in the graph.
-Also why are only chemistry teachers frontline other than special education workers?

-Enjoy the symmetry of the bubbles. 
-Interesting how many cashiers and fast food workers there are. 
-It would be good to color scale how frontline and essential the jobs are to a society. 
-Why isn't there a ""both"" category as essential and frontline? 
-How many different jobs need to be done to keep a system running is interesting. 
 
-How do they define ""frontline""? Farming, Forestry, and Fishing is frontline? 
-How do they define ""essential""? 
-Who isn't represented?  Students? Sports Players? FBI/Military?  Why aren't there more doctors? How are vets ""Frontline""? Why are DJs/announcers frontline? Why are 3 million registered nurses at the same level as 3 million manual material movers? 
 
What impact does this have on you and your community?
It helps put into perspective how many people are working to help fight Covid. 

-Directly, our community is affected most by Health Care because we have a lot of health care workers within our community. We have a lot of ""front line"" and ""essential"" workers in our community as parents, which affects our ability to open school back up if they are not vaccinated (or if they are sick).

6,Amelia C.,New York,"The groups of bubbles represent a larger population. The color key indicates that the grey portion are essential workers and the beige-yellow represents frontline workers. There are tinier bubbles in each section. The entire groups of bubbles usually have a few tinier bubbles that are the opposite color.
I am wondering if it is harder for frontline workers that are in an occupation primarily composed of essential workers to receive the attention and credit they deserve for their work? I am also wondering how the numbers of people in occupations have fluctuated over the course of the pandemic? Also, what are the comparisons of money made per group? Have the workers in some sections been paid less due to reduced profit from the pandemic?
This diagram represents a large amount of people who have been working through a pandemic and are serving their communities. Frontline workers have sacrificed their safety and sometimes even their lives to fulfill their jobs. They deserve our respect and honor. 
I am not sure who should receive the vaccine first, but it also depends on the side effects and how safe it is.

6,Jack Graham,Dallas,What I wonder is why do we need 4 million fast food workers and counter workers fast food restaurants are a high risk exposure to COVID-19 we should just need regular workers in regular restaurants and nice restaurants and we need more people to prepare food for the poor right now as well. The fast food restaurants should just do drive through. Also we should just stay at one million construction workers cause we do not need more buildings being built right now we need to focus on how we as a country are going to get through this pandemic. We do need people to repair things that have been broken or rusted over.,TRUE
6,Mason Brown,"Manhattan, New York","I noticed that there is a larger variety of size in the bubbles relating to frontline workers, compared to essential workers. This brings me to the assumption that there are less people who qualify to be an essential worker, and these people all come from major occupational groups such as education and office/administrative support

This makes me ponder the rubric which is used to determine whether someone is an essential worker, or just a front line worker. This was something that was apparent to me when I first viewed this set of information, because it seems to be an unanimous decision as to whether or not this rubric is accurate.

This graph has a huge impact on me, and most likely my community in many ways, but mostly in the process of streamlining our appreciation for the people who work each and every day of this pandemic. I am extremely grateful for all that our brave essential and frontline workers are doing, and I love how this set of information gives me the means to direct my appreciation to the people who deserve it.

6,Cooper Ullmann,Whidbey Island,"I noticed that there a lot more fields where every single occupation is frontline.

I wonder why there are only chemistry teachers as frontline. In our school the chem teacher is doing online still. And there has to be other classes where the subject needs to be taught in a hands on environment.

I wonder why chemistry teachers are considered frontline workers while medical and health service managers are essential.

2. I wonder about the criteria for essential and frontline occupations. Why are specifically postsecondary chemical teachers considered frontline occupations? Why aren't other subjects such as biology and English also considered frontline occupations?
