## 0. INTRODUCTION

Text classification is also called supervised Machine Learning for text
analysis. We used text classification assess the demonstration of data
literacy in an open online learning network. The dataset consists of
1431 observations of students' comments based on six activities
including [Climate
Threats](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/15/learning/whats-going-on-in-this-graph-climate-threats.html),
[Air
Pollution](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/11/learning/whats-going-on-in-this-graph-world-cities-air-pollution.html),
[U.S
Wellbeing](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/03/learning/whats-going-on-in-this-graph-us-well-being-compared-internationally.html),
[Covid Herd
Immunity](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/04/learning/whats-going-on-in-this-graph-covid-herd-immunity.html),
[Vaccination
Roadblocks](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/18/learning/whats-going-on-in-this-graph-vaccination-roadblocks.html),
and [First
Vaccinated](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/28/learning/whats-going-on-in-this-graph-first-vaccinated.html)
from the NY Times Learning Network.

**Data source**. To create the dataset, we first coded students'
comments with the following dimensions: match, tension, more
information, connection, challenge, affection, and science. These
dimensions demonstrate critical data literacy skills. For instance,
"challenge" entails the capacity of challenging data collection methods,
ways of representing data, interpreting data, etc. In each dimension, we
scored the comments using a 2-point scale (0-1). Taking "match" as an
example, if learners explained that their personal experiences matched
data trends (i.e., "My community is one of the areas under high water
stress. This is true because it gets really hot in the summer and we
need water."), their comments were scored as 1 point. Otherwise, we
scored the comments as 0 points. Reliability was calculated, based on
10% of comments from each activity, with Cohen's kappa. Kappa was found
to be above 0.8 for each dimension, indicating good reliability.

In this walkthrough, we will use the "more Information" dimension as an
example to address the following research question: **How can machine
learning be used to assess learners' critical data literacy in open
online learning environments?** The label of "more information" relates
to the extent to which the student demonstrates curiosity about other
data that the featured visualization did not show. This could be a
future trend or when the student sought more contexts to interpret data
trends.

### Text classification workflow

This workflow shows that to build a text classification model, we should
first turn text columns into features in data wrangling, and set up
training datasets and testing datasets for model development.
Specifically, before analysis, we'll take a quick look at the data and
understand the context of data collection. Then we turn the text column
into numeric features for data modeling. After that, we create two sets
of data and only use the training set for model development.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1. PREPARE

First, let's load the following packages that we'll be needing for this
walkthrough:

```{r load-packages, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
library(textrecipes)
library(discrim) #naive Bayes model is available in the tidymodels package discrim.
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. WRANGLE

To get started, we need to import, or "read", our data into R. The
function used to import your data will depend on the file format of the
data you are trying to import. First, however, you'll need to do the
following:

1.  Download the `comments.csv` file we'll be using.
2.  Create a folder in the directory on your computer where you stored
    your R Project and name it "data".
3.  Add the file to your data folder.
4.  Check your Files tab in RStudio to verify that your file is indeed
    in your data folder.

Now let's read our data into our Environment using the `read_csv()`
function and assign it to a variable name so we can work with it like
any other object in R. Then let's take a quick `glimpse()` at the data
to see what we have to work with.

```{r read-csv}
comments <- read_csv("data/comments.csv")

glimpse(comments)
```

We can see that the dataset includes five columns, activity (which
activity the comment came from), user_display_name (the name of users),
user_location (the location of users), comment (users' comments), and
more_info (whether the comment demonstrates students' data literacy in
the dimension of seeking for more information).

Let's look at the data! Here are the first six comments:

```{r}
head(comments$comment)
```

## 3. MODEL

Now, let's build a classification model with two columns in the dataset:
comment and more_info. We need to split the data into training and
testing datasets. We can use the `initial_split()` function from to
create this binary split of the data. The `strata` argument ensures that
the distribution of `more_info` is similar in the training set and
testing set. Since the split uses random sampling, we set a seed so we
can reproduce our results.

```{r}
set.seed(123)

comments <- comments %>%
  mutate(more_info=as.factor(more_info))

comments_split <- initial_split(comments, strata = more_info)

comments_train <- training(comments_split)
comments_test <- testing(comments_split)
```

We can check the dimensions of the two splits with the function `dim()`

```{r}
dim(comments_train)

dim(comments_test)
```

Next we need to preprocess this data (i.e., comment) to prepare it for
modeling; we have text data, and we need to build numeric features for
machine learning from that text. We first initialize our set of
preprocessing transformations with the `recipe()` function, using a
formula expression to specify the variables, our outcome (i.e.,
more_info) plus our predictor (i.e., comment), along with the data set
(i.e., comments_train). The comments_test data set is for the final
testing step and should not be used for building models.

```{r}
comments_rec <-
  recipe(more_info ~ comment, data = comments_train)
```

Now we add steps to process the comment variable. First we tokenize the
text to words with `step_tokenize()`. Before we calculate tf-idf we use
`step_tokenfilter()` to only keep the 1000 most frequent tokens, to
avoid creating too many variables in our model. To finish, we use
`step_tfidf()` to compute tf-idf.

```{r preprocessing comment variable}
comments_rec <- comments_rec %>%
  step_tokenize(comment) %>%
  step_tokenfilter(comment, max_tokens = 1e3) %>%
  step_tfidf(comment)
```

Let's create 10-fold cross-validation sets, and use these resampled sets
for performance estimates. In this way, 90% of the training data is
included in each fold, and the other 10% is held out for evaluation.

```{r}
set.seed(234)
comments_folds <- vfold_cv(comments_train)

comments_folds
```

Now let's set up a naive bayes model.

```{r}
nb_spec <- naive_Bayes() %>%
  set_mode("classification") %>%
  set_engine("naivebayes")

nb_spec
```

Now that we have a full specification of the preprocessing recipe and
set up a model, we can build up a tidymodels `workflow()` to bundle
together our modeling components.

```{r}
nb_wf <- workflow() %>%
  add_recipe(comments_rec) %>%
  add_model(nb_spec)

nb_wf
```

We fit one time to the training data as a whole. Now, to estimate how
well that model performs, let's fit the model many times, once to each
of these resampled folds, and then evaluate on the heldout part of each
resampled fold.

```{r}
nb_rs <- fit_resamples(
  nb_wf,
  comments_folds,
  control = control_resamples(save_pred = TRUE)
)
```

We can use `collect_metrics()` to get evaluation information.

```{r}
nb_rs_metrics <- collect_metrics(nb_rs)

nb_rs_metrics
```

Another way to evaluate our model is to evaluate the confusion matrix. A
confusion matrix tabulates a model's false positives and false negatives
for each class. The function conf_mat`()` computes a cross-tabulation of
observed and predicted classes. This allows us to visualize how well the
model performs and helps us to identify problems and think about ways to
address the problems.

```{r}
cm <- conf_mat(nb_rs[[5]][[1]], truth = more_info,
         estimate = .pred_class)

autoplot(cm, type = "heatmap")
```

##### ✅ Comprehension Check

What do you notice in the confusion matrix?

Replace the naive Bayes model with a SVM model and compare the results
from these two models:

1.  Does the SVM model work better than the naive Bayes model?
2.  Why does the SVM model work better (or worse)?
