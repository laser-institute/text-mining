## OVERVIEW

For Module 3, our primary goal is to build a basic understanding of topic modeling and how it has been applied to gain insight into text data, and specifically its applications in educational contexts. This week's readings and videos are intended to provide you with a brief introduction to these methods and some general applications across disciplines. Many of the introductory readings come from the [Journal of Digital Humanities (Vol. 2, No. 1 Winter 2012)](#0). The entire issue on Topic Modeling contains many good reads and is worth checking out in its entirety. [The Digital Humanities Contribution to Topic Modeling](#0) article provides a nice overview of the entire issue.

## READINGS

To help address our discussion questions for the week, you'll be asked to **read or view 3 resources**, including: 1) a required journal article, 2) an instructor-selected resource, and 3) a self-selected resource such as a journal article, video, news article, podcast, or blog post.

### 1. Required

1.  [Topic Modeling: A Basic Introduction](http://journalofdigitalhumanities.org/2-1/topic-modeling-a-basic-introduction-by-megan-r-brett/). Great layman's introduction to the topic of topic modeling by Megan Brett.

### 2. Instructor-Selected Resources (Choose One)

The resources curated below provide a comprehensive introduction to topic modeling, covering both theoretical foundations and practical implementations. They explore the mathematical principles underlying topic models, including probabilistic approaches like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Structural Topic Modeling (STM), while also emphasizing the importance of text preprocessing for accurate results. Several tutorials and hands-on examples demonstrate how to apply these methods using R, offering insights into different modeling approaches and best practices. Finally, a few resources take a more critical perspective, examining the limitations of topic modeling, its application to figurative language, and the challenges of working with large-scale data.

### 3. Self-Selected Resource

Use the [NCSU Library](#0), [Google Scholar](#0) or search engine of your choice to locate a journal article, presentation, website or other scholarly resource. **Your selection should discuss some form of topic modeling and address one or more of the discussion topics/questions provided below**. In addition, you are welcome to find less formal resources such as videos or shorter online articles to share with the class and that help us better understand this week's topics for discussion.

## DISCUSSION

In lieu of the peer interaction and discussion of course materials that normally take place "in class", you'll be asked to log in this week and engage with other members of our learning community through the course discussion forum. To help guide our discussions, **we will collectively address a set of guiding questions provided in each forum**. You are also welcome to add your own topics or questions for the class to discuss.

With the exception of the Self-Selected resource, **you are not required to post to every thread or address every question listed below**, particularly if you feel others in the class have thoroughly addressed the topic or questions. Our primary goal for these discussions is to collectively build our understanding of this week's topics through back-and-forth dialogue and avoid a "collective monologue" in which we see 20 variations of the same post.

### Guiding Questions

#### Topic 1: What is Topic Modeling? And other new terms.

Reflecting on the course text and your self-selected reading, answer one or more of the following questions:

1.  What exactly is "topic modeling"?

2.  What is it trying to accomplish and how does it work? 

3.  What are some other new terms, words, concepts that you have come across in the resources that were unfamiliar to you, or that you had come across before but feel you have a better understanding of after this week?

#### Topic 2: Applications in Education

Reflecting on the course text and your self-selected reading, answer one or more of the following questions:

1.  How has topic modeling been applied to educational contexts, or in other fields that might be relevant to education? 

2.  How have/could these methods be applied to better understand and improve student learning and the contexts in which learning occurs?  

3.  How might text mining be applied in your professional context? 

4.  How has/could text mining be applied to address systemic issues or persistent problems in Education?

#### Topic 3: Topic Modeling Measures

Reflecting on the course text and your self-selected reading, answer one or more of the following questions:

1.  What are some of the advantages of topic-modeling approaches compared to approaches we examined in Module 1 & 2?

2.  What are some of the issues, challenges, and limitations of this approach? 

#### Topic 5: Text-Based Data Sources

Reflecting on the course text and your self-selected reading, answer one or more of the following questions:

1.  What data sources were described in your readings or selections?

2.  Are some data sources more suitable or appropriate for dictionary-based methods than others?

3.  What data sources in education might be particularly suitable for dictionary-based approaches to analysis?

4.  What sources of data are you interested in potentially exploring for an independent analysis in this Module or for a final course project?

#### Student-Selected Resources

## ASSESSMENT EXAMPLE

### Grading

Grading for this week is fairly lenient, provided that it's fairly clear from your posts that you've done the required reading. Readings and discussion for each module are worth 6 points and judged based on three criteria: quantity, quality, and connections to readings.

In term of **quantity** (2 points), you'll be expected to add at least 4 posts over the course of the week and spread across at least two different days. *Your initial post should be shared by Friday* to help facilitate discussion.

In terms of **quality** (2 points), your posts over the next week should provide new or insightful contributions to the division questions or topics (see [Gao's productive online discussion model](https://scholarworks.bgsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1040&&context=vcte_pub&&sei-redir=1&referer=https%253A%252F%252Fscholar.google.com%252Fscholar%253Fhl%253Den%2526as_sdt%253D0%25252C34%2526q%253DGao%252Bproductive%252Bonline%252Bdiscussion%252Bmodel%2526btnG%253D#search=%22Gao%20productive%20online%20discussion%20model%22) summarized below). There is no requisite for the length of each posting; in fact short conversational exchanges (1-3 paragraphs) are highly encouraged.

In terms of **connections** (2 points), your collective posts should help us interpret or elaborate on discussion topics, questions, or ideas other have shared by "making connection to the learning materials" as illustrated in Gao's Disposition 1: Discussion to Comprehend. Your posts should tie in to at least 3 different resources.

### Productive Online Discussion Model

#### Disposition 1: Discuss to Comprehend
